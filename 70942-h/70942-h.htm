<p>We met Nettie Lynn on the street the
other day, and she cut us all dead. Considering
the sacrifices we had all made for her,
especially our dear Tish, who cut a hole in her
best rug on her account, this ungrateful conduct
forces me to an explanation of certain events
which have caused most unfair criticism. Whatever
the results, it is never possible to impugn
the motives behind Tish’s actions.</p>

<p>As for the janitor of Tish’s apartment house
maintaining that the fruit jar buried in the floor
was a portion of a still for manufacturing spirituous
liquors, and making the statement that Tish’s
famous blackberry cordial for medicinal use was
fifty per cent alcohol—I consider this beneath
comment. The recipe from which this cordial
is made was originated by Tish’s Greataunt
Priscilla, a painting of whom hangs, or rather
did hang, over the mantel in Tish’s living room.</p>

<p>The first notice Aggie and I received that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Tish was embarked on one of her kindly crusades
again was during a call from Charlie Sands.
We had closed our cottage at Lake Penzance and
Aggie was spending the winter with me. She
had originally planned to go to Tish, but at the
last moment Tish had changed her mind.</p>

<p>“You’d better go with Lizzie, Aggie,” she said.
“I don’t always want to talk, and you do.”</p>

<p>As Aggie had lost her upper teeth during an
unfortunate incident at the lake, which I shall
relate further on, and as my house was near her
dentist’s, she agreed without demur. To all seeming
the indications were for a quiet winter, and
save for an occasional stiffness in the arms, which
Tish laid to neuritis, she seemed about as usual.</p>

<p>In October, however, Aggie and I received a
visit from her nephew, and after we had given
him some of the cordial and a plate of Aggie’s
nut wafers he said, “Well, revered and sainted
aunts, what is the old girl up to now?”</p>

<p>We are not his aunts, but he so designates us.
I regret to say that by “the old girl” he referred
to his Aunt Letitia.</p>

<p>“Since the war,” I said with dignity, “your
Aunt Letitia has greatly changed, Charlie. We
have both noticed it. The great drama is over,
and she is now content to live on her memories.”</p>

<p>I regret to say that he here exclaimed, “Like——she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
is! I’ll bet you a dollar and a quarter
she’s up to something right now.”</p>

<p>Aggie gave a little moan.</p>

<p>“You have no basis for such a statement,” I
said sternly. But he only took another wafer and
more of our cordial. He was preventing a cold.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “But I’ve had considerable
experience, and she’s too quiet. Besides,
she asked me the other day if doubtful methods
were justifiable to attain a righteous end!”</p>

<p>“What did you tell her?” Aggie inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>“I said they were not; but she didn’t seem to
believe me. Now mark my words: After every
spell of quiet she has she goes out and gets in
the papers. So don’t say I haven’t warned you.”</p>

<p>But he had no real basis for his unjust suspicions,
and after eating all the nut wafers in the
house he went away.</p>

<p>“Just one thing,” he said: “I was around there
yesterday, and her place looked queer to me. I
missed a lot of little things she used to have. You
don’t suppose she’s selling them, do you?”</p>

<p>Well, Tish has plenty of money and that
seemed unlikely. But Aggie and I went around
that evening, and it was certainly true. Her
Cousin Mary Evans’ blue vases were gone from
the mantel of the living room, and her Grandaunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Priscilla’s portrait was missing from over
the fireplace. The china clock with wild roses
on it that Aggie had painted herself had disappeared,
and Tish herself had another attack
of neuritis and had her right arm hung in a sling.</p>

<p>She was very noncommital when I commented
on the bareness of the room.</p>

<p>“I’m sick of being cluttered up with truck,”
she said. “We surround our bodies with too many
things, and cramp them. The human body is
divine and beautiful, but we surround it with—er—china
clocks and what not, and it deteriorates.”</p>

<p>“Surround it with clothes, Tish,” I suggested,
but she waved me off.</p>

<p>“<i>Mens sana in corpore sano</i>,” she said.</p>

<p>She had wrenched her left knee, too, it appeared,
and so Hannah let us out. She went
into the outside corridor with us and closed the
door behind her.</p>

<p>“What did she say about her right arm and
her left leg?” she inquired.</p>

<p>When we told her she merely sniffed.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet she said she was sick of her aunt’s picture
and that clock, too,” she said. “Well, she’s
lying, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Hannah!”</p>

<p>“I call it that. She’s smashed them, and she’s
smashed her Grandfather Benton and the cut-glass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
salad bowl, and a window. And the folks
below are talking something awful.”</p>

<p>“Hannah! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Hannah wailed, and burst into
tears. “The things she says when she’s locked
me out! And the noise! You’d think she was
killing a rat with the poker. There’s welts an
inch deep in the furniture, and part of the cornice
is smashed. Neuritis! She’s lamed herself,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Maybe its a form of physical culture, Hannah,”
I suggested. “They jump about in that,
you know.”</p>

<p>“They don’t aim to kick the ceiling and break
it, do they?”</p>

<p>Well, that was quite true, and I’ll admit that
we went away very anxious. Aggie was inclined
to return to the unfortunate incident of the janitor
and the furnace pipe when Tish was learning
to shoot in the basement some years ago, and to
think that she had bought a muffler or whatever
it is they put on guns to stop the noise, and was
shooting in her flat. I myself inclined toward a
boomerang, one of which Tish had seen thrown
at a charity matinée, and which had much impressed
her. In fact, I happened to know that
she had tried it herself at least once, for on entering
her sitting room one day unexpectedly my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
bonnet was cut off my head without the slightest
warning. But Hannah had known about the
boomerang, and there would have been no need
of secrecy.</p>

<p>However, it was not long before Tish herself
explained the mystery, and to do so now I shall
return to the previous summer at Lake Penzance.
When we arrived in June we found to
our dismay that a new golf course had been laid
out, and that what was called the tenth hole was
immediately behind our cottage. On the very
first day of our arrival a golf ball entered the
kitchen window and struck Hannah, the maid,
just below the breast bone, causing her to sit on
the stove. She was three days in bed on her face
and had to drink her broth by leaning out over
the edge of the bed. This was serious enough,
but when gentlemen at different times came to
the cottage with parcels wrapped to look like
extra shoes, and asked Tish to keep them in the
refrigerator on the back porch, we were seriously
annoyed. Especially after one of them broke and
leaked into the ice-tea pitcher, and Aggie, who is
very fond of iced tea, looked cross-eyed for
almost half an hour.</p>

<p>Some of the language used, too, was most objectionable,
and the innocent children who carried
the clubs learned it, for I cannot possibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
repeat what a very small urchin said to Tish
when she offered him a quarter if he would learn
the Shorter Catechism. And even our clergyman’s
wife—the Ostermaiers have a summer cottage
near us—showed what we had observed was
the moral deterioration caused by the game. For
instance, one day she knocked a ball directly into
our garbage can, which happened to have its lid
off. Owing to the vines she could not see us, and
she hunted for some time, tearing at Aggie’s cannas
as though they were not there, and finally
found her ball in the can.</p>

<p>“Do I pick it out or play it out, caddie?” she
called.</p>

<p>“Cost you a shot to pick it out,” said the caddie.</p>

<p>“I’ll play it,” she said. “Give me a spoon.”</p>

<p>Well, it appeared that she did not mean a table
spoon, although that was certainly what she
needed, for he gave her a club, and she began to
dig after the ball. She made eleven jabs at it,
and then the can overturned.</p>

<p>“Oh, damm!” she said, and just then Aggie
sneezed.</p>

<p>“Darn!” said Mrs. Ostermaier, trying to pretend
that that was what she had said before.
“Are you there, Miss Carberry?”</p>

<p>“I am,” Tish replied grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose you never expected to see me doing
this!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Tish said slowly, “if anyone had told
me that I would find my clergyman’s wife in my
garbage can I might have been surprised. Hannah,
bring Mrs. Ostermaier the coal shovel.”</p>

<p>Looking back I perceive that our dear Tish’s
obsession dated from that incident, for when
Mrs. Ostermaier had cleaned up and moved
angrily away she left the old ball, covered with
coffee grounds, on the path. I am inclined, too,
to think that Tish made a few tentative attempts
with the ball almost immediately, for I found
my umbrella badly bent that night, and that something
had cracked a cane left by Charlie Sands,
which Aggie was in the habit of using as a pole
when fishing from the dock. Strangely enough,
however, her bitterness against the game seemed
to grow, rather than decrease.</p>

<p>For instance, one day when Aggie was sitting
on the edge of our little dock, fishing and reflecting,
and Tish was out in the motor boat, she
happened to see a caddie on the roof looking for a
ball which had lodged there. She began at once
to shout at him to get down and go away, and in
her indignation forgot to slow down the engine.
The boat therefore went directly through the dock
and carried it away, including that portion on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
which Aggie was sitting. Fortunately Aggie always
sat on an air cushion at such times, and as
she landed in a sitting position she was able to
remain balanced until Tish could turn the boat
around and come to the rescue. But the combination
of the jar and of opening her mouth to yell
unfortunately lost Aggie her upper set, as I have
before mentioned.</p>

<p>But it was not long before dear Tish’s argus
eye had discovered a tragedy on the links. A
very pretty girl played steadily, and always at
such times a young man would skulk along, taking
advantage of trees et cetera to keep out of
her sight, while at the same time watching her
hungrily. Now and then he varied his method
by sitting on the shore of the lake. He would
watch her until she came close, and then turn his
head and look out over the water. And if ever
I saw misery in a human face it was there.</p>

<p>Aggie’s heart ached over him, and she carried
him a cup of tea one afternoon. He seemed
rather surprised, but took it, and Aggie said there
was a sweetheart floating in it for him.</p>

<p>“A mermaid, eh?” he said. “Well, I’m for
her then. Mermaids haven’t any legs, and hence
can’t play golf, I take it.” But he looked out over
the lake again and resumed his bitter expression.
“You can’t tell, though. They may have a water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
variety, like polo.” He sighed and drank the
tea absently, but after that he cheered somewhat
and finally he asked Aggie a question.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d look at me,” he said. “I want
an outside opinion. Do I look like a golf hazard?”</p>

<p>“A what?” said Aggie.</p>

<p>“Would you think the sight of me would cut
ten yards off a drive, or a foot off a putt?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>“You look very nice, I’m sure,” Aggie replied.
But he only got up and shook the sand off himself
and stared after the girl.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” he said. “Very nice! You’ve hit
it.” Then he turned on her savagely, to her
great surprise. “If I weren’t so blamed nice I’d
set off a dozen sticks of dynamite on this crazy
links and blow myself up with the last one.”</p>

<p>Aggie thought he was a little mad.</p>

<p>We saw him frequently after that, never with
the girl, but he began to play the game himself.
He took some lessons, too, but Tish had to protest
for the way he and the professional talked
to each other. Mr. McNab would show him how
to fix his feet and even arrange his fingers on the
club handle. Then he would drive, and the ball
would roll a few feet and stop.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I waggled my ear that time,
or something,” he would say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Keep your eye on the ball!” Mr. McNab would
yell, dancing about. “Ye’ve got no strength of
character, mon.”</p>

<p>“Let me kick it, then. I’ll send it farther.”</p>

<p>After that they would quarrel, and Tish would
have to close the windows.</p>

<p>But Tish’s interest in golf was still purely that
of the onlooker. This is shown by the fact that
at this time and following the incident of the dock
she decided that we must all learn to swim. That
this very decision was to involve us in the fate
of the young man, whose name was Bobby Anderson,
could not have been foreseen, or that that
involvement would land us in various difficulties
and a police station.</p>

<p>Tish approached the swimming matter in her
usual convincing way.</p>

<p>“Man,” she said, “has conquered all the elements—earth,
air and water. He walks. He
flies. He swims—or should. The normal human
being to-day should be as much at home in water
as in the air, and vice versa, to follow the great
purpose.”</p>

<p>“If that’s the great purpose we would have
both wings and fins,” said Aggie rather truculently,
for she saw what was coming. But Tish
ignored her.</p>

<p>“Water,” she went on, “is sustaining. Hence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
boats. It is as easy to float the human body as a
ship.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” Aggie demanded. “I didn’t float so
you could notice it the night you backed the car
into the lake.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t try,” Tish said sternly. “You
opened your mouth to yell, and that was the equivalent
of a leak in a ship. I didn’t say a leaking
boat would float, did I?”</p>

<p>We thought that might end it, but it did not.
When we went upstairs to bed we heard her filling
the tub, and shortly after that she called us into
the bathroom. She was lying extended in the
tub, with a Turkish towel covering her, and she
showed us how, by holding her breath, she simply
had to stay on top of the water.</p>

<p>“I advise you both,” she said, “to make this
experiment to-night. It will give you confidence
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>We went out and closed the door, and Aggie
clutched me by the arm.</p>

<p>“I’ll die first, Lizzie,” she said. “I don’t intend
to learn to swim, and I won’t. A fortune teller
told me to beware of water, and that lake’s full
of tin cans.”</p>

<p>“She was floating in the tub, Aggie,” I said
to comfort her, although I felt a certain uneasiness
myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“Then that’s where I’ll do my swimming,”
Aggie retorted, and retired to her room.</p>

<p>The small incident of the next day would not
belong in this narrative were it not that it introduced
us to a better acquaintance with the Anderson
boy, and so led to what follows. For let
Charlie Sands say what he will, and he was very
unpleasant, the truth remains that our dear Tish’s
motives were of the highest and purest, and what
we attempted was to save the happiness of two
young lives.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, on the following morning
Tish came to breakfast in a mackintosh and bedroom
slippers, with an old knitted sweater and
the bloomers belonging to her camping outfit
beneath. She insisted after the meal that we
similarly attire ourselves, and sat on the veranda
while we did so, reading a book on the art of
swimming, which she had had for some time.</p>

<p>Although she was her usual calm and forceful
self both Aggie and I were very nervous, and for
fear of the chill Aggie took a small quantity of
blackberry cordial. She felt better after that
and would have jumped off the end of the dock,
but Tish restrained her, advising her to wet her
wrists first and thus to regulate and not shock
the pulse.</p>

<p>Tish waded out, majestically indifferent, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
trailed after her. Of what followed I am not
quite sure. I know, when we were out to our
necks, and either I had stepped on a broken bottle
or something had bitten me, she turned and said:</p>

<p>“This will do. I am going to float, Lizzie.
Give me time to come to the surface.”</p>

<p>She then took a long breath and threw herself
back into the water, disappearing at once. I
waited for some time, but only a foot emerged,
and that only for a second. I might have grown
anxious, but it happened that just then Aggie
yelled that there was a leech on her, sucking her
blood, and I turned to offer her assistance. One
way and another it was some time before I turned
to look again at Tish—and she had not come up.
The water was in a state of turmoil, however,
and now and then a hand or a leg emerged.</p>

<p>I was uncertain what to do. Tish does not like
to have her plans disarranged, and she had certainly
requested me to give her time. I could not
be certain, moreover, how much time would be
required. While I was debating the matter I was
astonished to hear a violent splashing near at
hand, and to see Mr. Anderson, fully dressed, approaching
us. He said nothing, but waited until
Tish’s foot again reappeared, and then caught it,
thus bringing her to the surface.</p>

<p>For some time she merely stood with her mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
open and her eyes closed. But at last she was
able to breathe and to speak, and in spite of my
affection for her I still resent the fact that her
first words were in anger.</p>

<p>“Lizzie, you are a fool!” she said.</p>

<p>“You said to give you time, Tish.”</p>

<p>“Well, you did!” she snapped. “Time to
drown.” She then turned to Mr. Anderson and
said, “Take me in, please. And go slowly. I
think I’ve swallowed a fish.”</p>

<p>I got her into the cottage and to bed, and for
an hour or two she maintained that she had
swallowed a fish and could feel it flopping
about inside her. But after a time the sensation
ceased and she said that either she had been
mistaken or it had died. She was very cold to
me.</p>

<p>Mr. Anderson called that afternoon to inquire
for her, and we took him to her room. But at
first he said very little, and continually consulted
his watch and then glanced out the window toward
the links. Finally he put the watch away
and drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“Four-seven,” he said despondently. “Just on
time, like a train! You can’t beat it.”</p>

<p>“What is on time?” Tish asked.</p>

<p>“It’s a personal matter,” he observed, and
lapsed into a gloomy silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Aggie went to the window, and I followed.
The pretty girl had sent her ball neatly onto the
green and, trotting over after it, proceeded briskly
to give it a knock and drop it into the cup. He
looked up at us with hopeless eyes.</p>

<p>“Holed in one, I suppose?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“She only knocked it once and it went in,”
Aggie said.</p>

<p>“It would.” His voice was very bitter. “She’s
the champion of this part of the country. She’s
got fourteen silver cups, two salad bowls, a card
tray and a soup tureen, all trophies. She’s never
been known to slice, pull or foozle. When she gets
her eye on the ball it’s there for keeps. Outside
of that, she’s a nice girl.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you learn the game yourself?” Tish
demanded.</p>

<p>“Because I can’t. I’ve tried. You must have
heard me trying. I can’t even caddie for her. I
look at her and lose the ball, and it has got to a
stage now where the mere sight of me on the links
costs her a stroke a hole. I’ll be frank with you,”
he added after a slight pause. “I’m in love with
her. Outside of golf hours she likes me too.
But the damned game—sorry, I apologize—the
miserable game is separating us. If she’d break
her arm or something,” he finished savagely, “I’d
have a chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>There was a thoughtful gleam in Tish’s eye
when he fell into gloomy silence.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there any remedy?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Not while she’s champion. A good beating
would help, but who’s to beat her?”</p>

<p>“You can’t?”</p>

<p>“Listen,” he said. “In the last few months,
here and at home, I’ve had ninety golf lessons,
have driven three thousand six hundred balls, of
which I lost four hundred and ninety-six, have
broken three drivers, one niblick and one putter.
I ask you,” he concluded drearily, “did you ever
hear before of anyone breaking a putter?”</p>

<p>The thoughtful look was still in Tish’s eye
when he left, but she said nothing. A day or two
after, we watched him with Mr. McNab, and although
he was standing with his back to the house
when he drove, we heard a crash overhead and
the sheet-iron affair which makes the stove draw
was knocked from the chimney and fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>He saw us and waved a hand at the wreckage.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” he called. “I keep a roofer now for
these small emergencies and I’ll send him over.”
Then he looked at Mr. McNab, who had sat down
on a bunker and had buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>“Come now, McNab,” he said. “Cheer up;
I’ve thought of a way. If I’m going to drive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
behind me, all I have to do is to play the game
backwards.”</p>

<p>Mr. McNab said nothing. He got up, gave him
a furious glance, and then with his hands behind
him and his head bent went back toward the clubhouse.
Mr. Anderson watched him go, teed another
ball and made a terrific lunge at it. It rose,
curved and went into the lake.</p>

<p>“Last ball!” he called to us cheerfully. “Got
one to lend me?”</p>

<p>I sincerely hope I am not doing Tish an injustice,
but she certainly said we had not. Yet
Mrs. Ostermaier’s ball——But she may have
lost it. I do not know.</p>

<p>It was Aggie who introduced us to Nettie Lynn,
the girl in the case. Aggie is possibly quicker
than the rest of us to understand the feminine
side of a love affair, for Aggie was at one time
engaged to a Mr. Wiggins, a gentleman who had
pursued his calling as master roofer on and finally
off a roof. [More than once that summer Tish
had observed how useful he would have been to
us at that time, as we were constantly having
broken slates, and as the water spout was completely
stopped with balls.] And Aggie maintained
that Nettie Lynn really cared for Mr.
Anderson.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Wiggins were living,” she said gently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
“and if I played golf, if he appeared unexpectedly
while I was knocking the ball or whatever it is
they do to it, if I really cared—and you know,
Tish, I did—I am sure I should play very badly.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need all those ifs to reach that conclusion,”
Tish said coldly.</p>

<p>A day or two later Aggie stopped Miss Lynn
and offered her some orangeade, and she turned
out to be very pleasant and friendly. But when
Tish had got the conversation switched to Mr.
Anderson she was cool and somewhat scornful.</p>

<p>“Bobby?” she said, lifting her eyebrows. “Isn’t
he screamingly funny on the links!”</p>

<p>“He’s a very fine young man,” Tish observed,
eying her steadily.</p>

<p>“He has no temperament.”</p>

<p>“He has a good disposition. That’s something.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she admitted carelessly. “He’s as
gentle as a lamb.”</p>

<p>Tish talked it over after she had gone. She
said that the girl was all right, but that conceit
over her game had ruined her, and that the only
cure was for Bobby to learn and then beat her
to death in a tournament or something, but that
Bobby evidently couldn’t learn, and so that was
that. She then fell into one of those deep silences
during which her splendid mind covers enormous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
ranges of thought, and ended by saying something
to the effect that if one could use a broom one
should be able to do something else.</p>

<p>We closed up the cottage soon after and returned
to town.</p>

<p>Now and then we saw Nettie Lynn on the
street, and once Tish asked us to dinner and we
found Bobby Anderson there. He said he had
discovered a place in a department store to practice
during the winter, with a net to catch the
balls, but that owing to his unfortunate tendencies
he had driven a ball into the well of the store,
where it had descended four stories and hit a
manager on the back. He was bent over bowing
to a customer or it would have struck his head
and killed him.</p>

<p>“She was there,” he said despondently. “She
used to think I was only a plain fool. Now she
says I’m dangerous, and that I ought to take out
a license for carrying weapons before I pick up
a club.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why you want to marry her,”
Tish said in a sharp voice.</p>

<p>“I don’t either,” he agreed. “But I do. That’s the
hell—I beg your pardon—that’s the deuce of it.”</p>

<p>It was following this meeting that the mysterious
events occurred with which I commenced this
narrative. And though there may be no connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
it was only a day or two later that I read
aloud to Aggie an item in a newspaper stating that
an elderly woman who refused to give her name
had sent a golf ball through the practice net in a
downtown store and that the ball had broken and
sent off a fire alarm, with the result that the sprinkling
system, which was a new type and not dependent
on heat, had been turned on in three
departments. I do know, however, that Tish’s
new velvet hat was never seen from that time on,
and that on our shopping excursions she never
entered that particular store.</p>

<p>In coming now to the events which led up to
the reason for Nettie Lynn cutting us, and to
Charlie Sands’ commentary that his wonderful
aunt, Letitia Carberry, should remember the commandment
which says that honesty is the best
policy—I am sure he was joking, for that is not
one of the great Commandments—I feel that a
certain explanation is due. This explanation is
not an apology for dear Tish, but a statement of
her point of view.</p>

<p>Letitia Carberry has a certain magnificence of
comprehension. If in this magnificence she loses
sight of small things, if she occasionally uses perhaps
unworthy methods to a worthy end, it is
because to her they are not important. It is only
the end that counts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>She has, too, a certain secrecy. But that is because
of a nobility which says in effect that by
planning alone she assumes sole responsibility. I
think also that she has little confidence in Aggie
and myself, finding us but weak vessels into which
she pours in due time the overflow from her own
exuberant vitality and intelligence.</p>

<p>With this in mind I shall now relate the small
events of the winter. They were merely straws,
showing the direction of the wind of Tish’s mind.
And I dare say we were not observant. For
instance, we reached Tish’s apartment one afternoon
to find the janitor there in a very ugly frame
of mind. “You threw something out of this
window, Miss Carberry,” he said, “and don’t be
after denying it.”</p>

<p>“What did I throw out of the window?” Tish
demanded loftily. “Produce it.”</p>

<p>“If it wasn’t that it bounced and went over the
fence,” he said, “I’d be saying it was a flat-iron.
That parrot just squawked once and turned
over.”</p>

<p>“Good riddance, too,” Tish observed. “The
other tenants ought to send me a vote of thanks.”</p>

<p>“Six milk bottles on Number Three’s fire escape,”
the janitor went on, counting on his fingers;
“the wash line broke for Number One and all the
clothes dirty, and old Mr. Ferguson leaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
out to spit and almost killed—it’s no vote of
thanks you’ll be getting.”</p>

<p>When she had got rid of him Tish was her
usual cool and dignified self. She offered no explanation
and we asked for none. And for a
month or so nothing happened. Tish distributed
her usual list of improving books at the Sunday-school
Christmas treat, and we packed our customary
baskets for the poor. On Christmas Eve
we sang our usual carols before the homes of our
friends, and except for one mischance, owing to
not knowing that the Pages had rented their house,
all was symbolic of the peace and good will of the
festive period. At the Pages’, however, a very
unpleasant person asked us for —— sake to go
away and let him sleep.</p>

<p>But shortly after the holidays Tish made a
proposition to us, and stated that it was a portion
of a plan to bring about the happiness of two
young and unhappy people.</p>

<p>“In developing this plan,” she said, “it is essential
that we all be in the best of physical condition;
what I believe is known technically as in
the pink. You two, for instance, must be able
to walk for considerable distances, carrying a
weight of some size.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘in the pink’?” Aggie
asked suspiciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“What you are not,” Tish said with a certain
scorn. “How many muscles have you got?”</p>

<p>“All I need,” said Aggie rather acidly.</p>

<p>“And of all you have, can you use one muscle,
outside of the ordinary ones that carry you
about?”</p>

<p>“I don’t need to.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever stood up, naked to the air, and
felt shame at your flaccid muscles and your puny
strength?”</p>

<p>“Really, Tish!” I protested. “I’ll walk if you
insist. But I don’t have to take off my clothes
and feel shame at my flabbiness to do it.”</p>

<p>She softened at that, and it ended by our agreeing
to fall in with her mysterious plan by going
to a physical trainer. I confess to a certain tremor
when we went for our first induction into the
profundities of bodily development. There was
a sign outside, with a large picture of a gentleman
with enormous shoulders and a pigeon breast,
and beneath it were the words: “I will make you
a better man.” But Tish was confident and calm.</p>

<p>The first day, however, was indeed trying. We
found, for instance, that we were expected to take
off all our clothing and to put on one-piece jersey
garments, without skirts or sleeves, and reaching
only to the knees. As if this were not enough, the
woman attendant said when we were ready “In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
you go, dearies,” and shoved us into a large bare
room where a man was standing with his
chest thrown out, and wearing only a pair
of trousers and a shirt which had shrunk to
almost nothing. Aggie clutched me by the
arm.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to have stockings, Lizzie!” she whispered.
“I don’t feel decent.”</p>

<p>But the woman had closed the door, and Tish
was explaining that we wished full and general
muscular development.</p>

<p>“The human body,” she said, “instantly responds
to care and guidance, and what we wish
is simply to acquire perfect coördination. ‘The
easy slip of muscles underneath the polished
skin,’ as some poet has put it.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” said the man. “All right. Lie down
in a row on the mat, and when I count, raise the
right leg in the air and drop it. Keep on doing
it. I’ll tell you when to stop.”</p>

<p>“Lizzie!” Aggie threw at me in an agony.
“Lizzie, I simply can’t!”</p>

<p>“Quick,” said the trainer. “I’ve got four
pounds to take off a welterweight this afternoon.
Right leg, ladies. Up, down; one, two——”</p>

<p>Never since the time in Canada when Aggie
and I were taking a bath in the lake, and a fisherman
came and fished from a boat for two hours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
while we sat in the icy water to our necks, have I
suffered such misery.</p>

<p>“Other leg,” said the trainer. And later:
“Right leg up, cross, up, down. Left leg up,
cross, up, down.” Aside from the lack of dignity
of the performance came very soon the excruciating
ache of our weary flesh. Limb by limb
and muscle by muscle he made us work, and when
we were completely exhausted on the mat he
stood us up on our feet in a row and looked us
over.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a long way to go, ladies,” he said
sternly. “It’s a gosh-awful shame the way you
women neglect your bodies. Hold in the abdomen
and throw out the chest. Balance easily on
the ball of the foot. Now touch the floor with
the finger tips, as I do.”</p>

<p>“Young man,” I protested, “I haven’t been able
to do that since I was sixteen.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve had a long rest,” he said coldly.
“Put your feet apart. That’ll help.”</p>

<p>When the lesson was over we staggered out,
and Aggie leaned against a wall and moaned.
“It’s too much, Tish,” she said feebly. “I’m all
right with my clothes on, and anyhow, I’m satisfied
as I am. I’m the one to please, not that
wretch in there.”</p>

<p>Tish, however, had got her breath and said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
that she felt like a new woman, and that blood had
got to parts of her it had never reached before.
But Aggie went sound asleep in the cabinet bath
and had to be assisted to the cold shower. I mention
this tendency of hers to sleep, as it caused
us some trouble later on.</p>

<p>In the meantime Tish was keeping in touch with
the two young people. She asked Nettie Lynn to
dinner one night, and seemed greatly interested
in her golf methods. One thing that seemed
particularly to interest her was Miss Lynn’s
device for keeping her head down and her eye
on the ball.</p>

<p>“After I have driven,” she said, “I make it a
rule to count five before looking up.”</p>

<p>“How do you see where the ball has gone?”
Tish asked.</p>

<p>“That is the caddie’s business.”</p>

<p>“I see,” Tish observed thoughtfully, and proceeded
for some moments to make pills of her
bread and knock them with her fork, holding her
head down as she did so.</p>

<p>Another thing which she found absorbing was
Miss Lynn’s statement that a sound or movement
while she drove was fatal, and that even a shadow
thrown on the ball while putting decreased her
accuracy.</p>

<p>By the end of February we had become accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
to the exercises and now went through them
with a certain sprightliness, turning back somersaults
with ease, and I myself now being able to
place my flat hand on the floor while standing.
Owing to the cabinet baths I had lost considerable
flesh and my skin seemed a trifle large for me in
places, while Aggie looked, as dear Tish said, like
a picked spare rib.</p>

<p>At the end of February, however, our training
came to an abrupt end, owing to a certain absent-mindedness
on Tish’s part. Tish and Aggie had
gone to the gymnasium without me, and at ten
o’clock that night I telephoned Tish to ask if
Aggie was spending the night with her. To my
surprise Tish said nothing for a moment, and
then asked me in a strained voice to put on my
things at once and meet her at the door to the
gymnasium building.</p>

<p>Quick as I was, she was there before me, hammering
at the door of the building, which appeared
dark and deserted. It appeared that the
woman had gone home early with a cold, and
that Tish had agreed to unfasten the bath cabinet
and let Aggie out at a certain time, but that she
had remembered leaving the electric iron turned
on at home and had hurried away, leaving Aggie
asleep and helpless in the cabinet.</p>

<p>The thought of our dear Aggie, perspiring her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
life away, made us desperate, and on finding no
response from within the building Tish led the
way to an alleyway at the side and was able to
reach the fire escape. With mixed emotions I
watched her valiant figure disappear, and then
returned to the main entrance, through which
I expected her to reappear with our unhappy
friend.</p>

<p>But we were again unfortunate. A few moments
later the door indeed was opened, but to
give exit to Tish in the grasp of a very rude and
violent watchman, who immediately blew loudly
on a whistle. I saw at once that Tish meant to
give no explanation which would involve taking
a strange man into the cabinet room, where our
hapless Aggie was completely disrobed and helpless;
and to add to our difficulties three policemen
came running and immediately placed us under
arrest.</p>

<p>Fortunately the station house was near, and we
were saved the ignominy of a police wagon. Tish
at once asked permission to telephone Charlie
Sands, and as he is the night editor of a newspaper
he was able to come at once. But Tish
was of course reticent as to her errand before so
many men, and he grew slightly impatient.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “I know you were in the
building. I know how you got in. But why? I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
don’t think you were after lead pipe or boxing
gloves, but these men do.”</p>

<p>“I left something there, Charlie.”</p>

<p>“Go a little further. What did you leave
there?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you. But I’ve got to go back there
at once. Every moment now——”</p>

<p>“Get this,” said Charlie Sands sternly: “Either
you come over with the story or you’ll be locked up.
And I’m bound to say I think you ought to be.”</p>

<p>In the end Tish told the unhappy facts, and
two reporters, the sergeant and the policemen
were all deeply moved. Several got out their
handkerchiefs, and the sergeant turned quite red
in the face. One and all they insisted on helping
to release our poor Aggie, and most of them escorted
us back to the building, only remaining in
the corridor at our request while we entered the
cabinet room.</p>

<p>Although we had expected to find Aggie in a
parboiled condition the first thing which greeted
us was a violent sneeze.</p>

<p>“Aggie!” I called desperately.</p>

<p>She sneezed again, and then said in a faint
voice, “Hurry up. I’b dearly frozed.”</p>

<p>We learned later that the man in charge had
turned off all the electricity when he left, from a
switch outside, and that Aggie had perspired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
copiously and been on the verge of apoplexy until
six o’clock, and had nearly frozen to death afterwards.
Tish draped a sheet around the cabinet,
and the policemen et cetera came in. Aggie gave
a scream when she saw them, but it was proper
enough, with only her head showing, and they
went out at once to let her get her clothing on.</p>

<p>Before he put us in a taxicab that night Charlie
Sands spoke to Tish with unjustifiable bitterness.</p>

<p>“I have given the watchman twenty dollars for
that tooth you loosened, Aunt Tish,” he said.
“And I’ve got to set up some food for the rest of
this outfit. Say, fifty dollars, for which you’d
better send me a check.” He then slammed the
door, but opened it immediately. “I just want to
add this,” he said: “If my revered grandfather
has turned over in his grave as much as I think
he has, he must be one of the liveliest corpses
underground.”</p>

<p>I am happy to record that Aggie suffered
nothing more than a heavy cold in the head. But
she called Tish up the next morning and with
unwonted asperity said, “I do thig, Tish, that you
bight have put a strig aroud your figer or
sobethig, to rebeber be by!”</p>

<p>It was but a week or two after this that Tish
called me up and asked me to go to her apartment
quickly, and to bring some arnica from the drug<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
store. I went as quickly as possible, to find
Hannah on the couch in the sitting room moaning
loudly, and Tish putting hot flannels on her knee
cap.</p>

<p>“It’s broken, Miss Tish,” she groaned. “I
know it is.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Tish. “Anyhow I called to
you to stay out.”</p>

<p>In the center of the room was a queer sort of
machine, with a pole on an iron base and a dial
at the top, and a ball fastened to a wire. There
was a golf club on the floor.</p>

<p>Later on, when Hannah had been helped to her
room and an arnica compress adjusted, Tish took
me back and pointed to the machine.</p>

<p>“Two hundred and twenty yards, Lizzie,” she
said, “and would have registered more but for
Hannah’s leg. That’s driving.”</p>

<p>She then sat down and told me the entire plan.
She had been working all winter, and was now
confident that she could defeat Nettie Lynn. She
had, after her first experience in the department
store, limited herself—in another store—to approach
shots. For driving she had used the machine.
For putting she had cut a round hole in
the carpet and had sawed an opening in the floor
beneath, in which she had placed a wide-mouthed
jar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“My worst trouble, Lizzie,” she said, “was lifting
my head. But I have solved it. See here.”</p>

<p>She then produced a short leather strap, one
end of which she fastened to her belt and the other
she held in her teeth. She had almost lost a front
tooth at the beginning, she said, but that phase
was over.</p>

<p>“I don’t even need it any more,” she told me.
“To-morrow I shall commence placing an egg on
the back of my neck as I stoop, and that with a
feeling of perfect security.”</p>

<p>She then looked at me with her serene and
confident glance.</p>

<p>“It has been hard work, Lizzie,” she said. “It
is not over. It is even possible that I may call on
you to do things which your ethical sense will at
first reject. But remember this, and then decide:
The happiness of two young and tender hearts
is at stake.”</p>

<p>She seemed glad of a confidante, and asked me
to keep a record of some six practice shots, as
shown by the dial on the machine. I have this
paper before me as I write:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1st drive, 230 yards. Slight pull.</p>

<p>2nd drive, 245 yards. Direct.</p>

<p>3rd drive, 300 yards. Slice.</p>

<p>4th drive, 310 yards. Direct.</p>

<p>5th drive. Wire broke.</p>

<p>6th drive. Wire broke again. Ball went through window
pane. Probably hit dog, as considerable howling outside.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>She then showed me her clubs, of which she
had some forty-six, not all of which, however, she
approved of. It was at that time that dear Tish
taught me the names of some of them, such as
niblick, stymie, cleek, mashie, putter, stance, and
brassie, and observed mysteriously that I would
need my knowledge later on. She also advised
that before going back to Penzance we walk increasing
distances every day.</p>

<p>“Because,” she said, “I shall need my two devoted
friends this summer; need them perhaps
as never before.”</p>

<p>I am bound to confess, however, that on our
return to Penzance Tish’s first outdoor work at
golf was a disappointment. She had a small ritual
when getting ready; thus she would say, firmly,
suiting the action to the phrase: “Tee ball. Feet
in line with ball, advance right foot six inches,
place club, overlap right thumb over left thumb,
drop arms, left wrist rigid, head down, eye on
the ball, shoulders steady, body still. Drive!”
Having driven she then stood and counted five
slowly before looking up.</p>

<p>At first, however, she did not hit the ball, or
would send it only a short distance. But she
worked all day, every day, and we soon saw a
great improvement. As she had prophesied, she
used us a great deal. For instance, to steady her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
nerves she would have us speak to her when driving,
and even fire a revolver out toward the lake.</p>

<p>We were obliged to stop this, however, for we
were in the habit of using the barrel buoy of the
people next door to shoot at, until we learned that
it was really not a buoy at all, but some fine old
whiskey which they were thus concealing, and
which leaked out through the bullet holes.</p>

<p>We were glad to find that Nettie Lynn and
Bobby were better friends than they had been the
year before, and to see his relief when Tish told
him to give up his attempts at golf altogether.</p>

<p>“I shall defeat her so ignominiously, Bobby,”
she said, “that she will never wish to hear of the
game again.”</p>

<p>“You’re a great woman, Miss Carberry,” he
said solemnly.</p>

<p>“But you, too, must do your part.”</p>

<p>“Sure I’ll do my part. Name it to me, and that
is all.”</p>

<p>But he looked grave when she told him.</p>

<p>“First of all,” she said, “you are to quarrel
with her the night before the finals. Violently.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say!”</p>

<p>“Second, when she is crushed with defeat you
are to extract a promise, an oath if you like, that
she is through with golf.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know her,” he said. “Might as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
well expect her to be through with her right
hand.”</p>

<p>But he agreed to think it over and, going out
to the lake front, sat for a long time lost in
thought. When he came back he agreed, but
despondently.</p>

<p>“She may love me after all this,” he said, “but
I’m darned if I think she’ll like me.”</p>

<p>But he cheered up later and planned the things
they could do when they were both free of golf
and had some time to themselves. And Mr.
McNab going by at that moment, he made a most
disrespectful gesture at his back.</p>

<p>It is painful, in view of what followed, to recall
his happiness at that time.</p>

<p>I must confess that Aggie and I were still in
the dark as to our part in the tournament. And
our confusion as time went on was increased by
Tish’s attitude toward her caddie. On her first
attempt he had been impertinent enough, goodness
knows, and Tish had been obliged to reprove
him.</p>

<p>“Your business here, young man,” she said, “is
to keep your eye on the ball.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what you’re not doing,” he said
smartly. “Lemme show you.”</p>

<p>Tish said afterwards that it was purely an accident,
for he broke every rule of stance and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
on, but before she realized his intention he had
taken the club from her hand and sent the ball
entirely out of sight.</p>

<p>“That’s the way,” he said. “Whale ’em!”</p>

<p>But recently her attitude to him had changed.
She would bring him in and give him cake and
ginger ale, and she paid him far too much. When
Hannah showed her disapproval he made faces
at her behind Tish’s back, and once he actually
put his thumb to his nose. To every remonstrance
Tish made but one reply.</p>

<p>“Develop the larger viewpoint,” she would observe,
“and remember this: I do nothing without
a purpose.”</p>

<p>“Then stop him making snoots at me,” said
Hannah. “I’ll poison him, that’s what I’ll do.”</p>

<p>Thus our days went on. The hours of light
Tish spent on the links. In the evenings her busy
fingers were not idle, for she was making herself
some knickerbockers from an old pair of trousers
which Charlie Sands had left at the cottage, cutting
them off below the knee and inserting elastic
in the hem, while Aggie and I, by the shade of our
lamp, knitted each a long woolen stocking to complete
the outfit.</p>

<p>It was on such an evening that Tish finally
revealed her plan, that plan which has caused
so much unfavorable comment since. The best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
answer to that criticism is Tish’s own statement
to us that night.</p>

<p>“Frankly,” she admitted, “the girl can beat me.
But if she does she will continue on her headstrong
way, strewing unhappiness hither and yon. She
must not win!”</p>

<p>Briefly the plan she outlined was based on the
undermining of Nettie’s morale. Thus, Aggie
sneezes during the hay-fever season at the mere
sight of a sunflower. She was to keep one in her
pocket, and at a signal from Tish was to sniff at
it, holding back the resultant sneeze, however,
until the champion was about to drive.</p>

<p>“I’ll be thirty yards behind, with the crowd,
won’t I?” Aggie asked.</p>

<p>“You will be beside her,” Tish replied solemnly.
“On the day of the finals the caddies will go on
a strike, and I shall insist that a strange caddie
will spoil my game, and ask for you.”</p>

<p>It appeared that I was to do nothing save to
engage Mr. McNab in conversation at certain
times and thus distract his attention, the signal
for this being Tish placing her right hand in her
trousers pocket. For a sneeze from Aggie the
signal was Tish coughing once.</p>

<p>“At all times, Aggie,” she finished, “I shall
expect you to keep ahead of us, and as near Nettie
Lynn’s ball as possible. The undulating nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
of the ground is in our favor, and will make it
possible now and then for you to move it into a
less favorable position. If at the fourteenth hole
you can kick it into the creek it will be very helpful.”</p>

<p>Aggie was then rehearsed in the signals, and
did very well indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. McNab was an occasional visitor those
days. He was watching Tish’s game with interest.</p>

<p>“Ye’ll never beat the champion, ma’m,” he
would say, “but ye take the game o’ gowf as it
should be taken, wi’ humility and prayer.”</p>

<p>More than once he referred to Bobby Anderson,
saying that he was the only complete failure
of his experience, and that given a proper chance
he would make a golfer of him yet.</p>

<p>“The mon has aye the build of a gowfer,” he
would say wistfully.</p>

<p>It is tragic now to remember that incident of
the day before the opening of the tournament,
when Bobby came to our cottage and we all ceremoniously
proceeded to the end of the dock and
flung his various clubs, shoes, balls, cap and bag
into the lake, and then ate a picnic supper on the
shore. When the moon came up he talked of the
future in glowing terms.</p>

<p>“I feel in my bones, Miss Tish,” he said, “that
you will beat her. And I know her; she won’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
stand being defeated, especially by——” Here
he coughed, and lost the thread of this thought.
“I’m going to buy her a horse,” he went on. “I’m
very fond of riding.”</p>

<p>He said, however, that it was going to be very
hard for him to quarrel with her the evening
before the finals.</p>

<p>“I’m too much in love,” he confessed. “Besides,
outside of golf we agree on everything—politics,
religion, bridge; everything.”</p>

<p>It was then that Tish made one of her deeply
understanding comments.</p>

<p>“Married life is going to be very dull for you
both,” she said.</p>

<p>It was arranged that in spite of the quarrel he
should volunteer to caddie for the champion the
day of the strike, and to take a portion of Aggie’s
responsibility as to changing the lie of the ball,
and so forth. He was not hopeful, however.</p>

<p>“She won’t want me any more than the
measles,” he said.</p>

<p>“She can’t very well refuse, before the crowd,”
Tish replied.</p>

<p>I pass with brief comment over the early days
of the women’s tournament. Mrs. Ostermaier
was eliminated the first day with a score of 208,
and slapped her caddie on the seventeenth green.
Tish turned in only a fair score, and was rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
depressed; so much so that she walked in her
sleep and wakened Aggie by trying to tee a ball
on the end of her—Aggie’s—nose. But the next
day she was calm enough, and kept her nerves
steady by the simple device of knitting as she
followed the ball. The result was what she had
expected, and the day of the finals saw only Nettie
Lynn and our dear Tish remaining.</p>

<p>All worked out as had been expected. The
caddies went on a strike that day, and before the
field Nettie was obliged to accept Bobby’s offer to
carry her clubs. But he was very gloomy and
he brought his troubles to me.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve done it,” he said. “And I’m ruined
for life. She never wants to see me again. It’s
my belief,” he added gloomily, “that she could
have bit the head off an iron club last night and
never have known she had done it.”</p>

<p>He groaned and mopped his face with his
handkerchief.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure it’s the right thing after all,” he
said. “The madder she is the better she’ll play.
All she’s got to do is to imagine I’m the ball, and
she’ll knock it a thousand yards.”</p>

<p>There was some truth in this probably, for she
certainly overshot the first hole, and the way she
said “Mashie!” to Bobby Anderson really sounded
like an expletive. Tish won that hole, they halved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
the second, and owing to Aggie sneezing without
apparent cause during Tish’s drive on the third,
Nettie took it. On the fourth, however, Tish was
fortunate and drove directly into the cup.</p>

<p>We now entered the undulating portion of the
course, and I understand that Bobby and Aggie
both took advantage of this fact to place Nettie
Lynn’s ball in occasional sand traps, and once to
lose it altogether. Also that the device of sneezing
during a putt was highly effective, so that at the
ninth hole dear Tish was three up.</p>

<p>Considering the obloquy which has fallen to me
for my own failure to coöperate, I can only state
as follows: I engaged Mr. McNab steadily in
conversation, and when he moved to a different
position I faithfully followed him; but I was
quite helpless when he suddenly departed, taking
an oblique course across the field, nor could I
approach Tish to warn her.</p>

<p>And on the surface all continued to go well. It
was now evident to all that the champion was
defeated, and that the champion knew it herself.
In fact the situation was hopeless, and no one, I
think, was greatly surprised when after driving
for the fourteenth hole she suddenly threw down
her club, got out her handkerchief and left the
course, followed by Bobby.</p>

<p>Our misfortune was that Aggie was ahead in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
the hollow and did not see what had happened.
Her own statement is that she saw the ball come
and fall into a dirt road, and that all she did was
to follow it and step on it, thus burying it out of
sight; but also that no sooner had she done this
than Mr. McNab came charging out of the woods
like a mad bull and rushed at her, catching her by
the arm.</p>

<p>It was at that moment that our valiant Tish,
flushed with victory, came down the slope.</p>

<p>Mr. McNab was dancing about and talking in
broad Scotch, but Tish finally caught the drift of
what he was saying—that he had suspected us all
day, that we would go before the club board, and
that Tish would get no cup.</p>

<p>“You’ve played your last gowf on these links,
Miss Carberry, and it’s a crying shame the bad
name you’ve gien us,” was the way he finished,
all the time holding to Aggie’s arm. It was thus
I found them.</p>

<p>“Very well,” Tish said in her coldest tone. “I
shall be very glad to state before the board my
reasons, which are excellent. Also to register a
protest against using the lake front before my
cottage for the cooling of beer, et cetera. I dare
say I may go home first?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be going with you, then.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” Tish replied. “And be good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
enough to release Miss Pilkington. She was
merely obeying my instructions.” Thus our lion-hearted
Tish, always ready to assume responsibility,
never weakening, always herself.</p>

<p>I come now to a painful portion of this narrative,
and the reason for Nettie Lynn cutting us
dead on the street. For things moved rapidly
within the next few moments. Mr. McNab settled
himself like a watchdog on our cottage steps,
and there Tish herself carried him some blackberry
cordial and a slice of coconut cake. There,
too, in her impressive manner she told him the
story of the plot.</p>

<p>“Think of it, Mr. McNab,” she said. “Two
young and loving hearts yearning for each other,
and separated only by the failure of one of them
to learn the game of golf!”</p>

<p>Mr. McNab was profoundly moved.</p>

<p>“He wouldna keep his eye on the ball,” he said
huskily. “I like the lad fine, but he would aye lift
his heid.”</p>

<p>“If this brings them together you would not
part them, would you?”</p>

<p>“He wouldna fallow through, Miss Carberry.
He juist hit the ball an’ quit.”</p>

<p>“If they were married, and he could give his
mind to the game he’d learn it, Mr. McNab.”</p>

<p>The professional brightened. “Maybe. Maybe,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
he said. “He has the body of the gowfer. If
he does that, we’ll say na mair, Miss Carberry.”</p>

<p>And, do what we would, Mr. McNab stood firm
on that point. The thought of his failure with
Bobby Anderson had rankled, and now he made
it a condition of his silence on the day’s events
that he have a free hand with him that summer.</p>

<p>“Gie him to me for a month,” he said, “and
he’ll be a gowfer, and na care whether he’s married
or no.”</p>

<p>We ate our dinner that night in a depressed
silence, although Tish’s silver cup graced the
center of the table. Before we had finished,
Bobby Anderson came bolting in and kissed us
each solemnly.</p>

<p>“It’s all fixed,” he said. “She has solemnly
sworn never to play golf again, and I’ve brought
her clubs down to follow mine into the lake.”</p>

<p>“You’d better keep them,” Tish said. “You’re
going to need them.”</p>

<p>She then broke the news to him, and considering
the months she had spent to help him he was very
ungrateful, I must say. Indeed, his language was
shocking.</p>

<p>“Me learn golf?” he shouted. “You tell McNab
to go to perdition and take his cursed golf
links with him. I won’t do it! This whole scheme
was to eliminate golf from my life. It has pursued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
me for three years. I have nightmares
about it. I refuse. Tell McNab I’ve broken my
leg. Wait a minute and I’ll go out and break it.”</p>

<p>But he could not refuse, and he knew it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>So far as we know, Nettie Lynn has never
played golf since. She impresses me as a person
of her word. But why she should be so bitter
toward us we cannot understand. As dear Tish
frequently remarks, who could have foreseen that
Mr. McNab would actually make a golfer out of
Bobby? Or that he would become so infatuated
with the game as to abandon practically everything
else?</p>

<p>They are married now, and Hannah knows
their cook. She says it is sometimes nine o’clock
at night in the summer before he gets in to dinner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_BABY_BLIMP">THE BABY BLIMP</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Ever since last spring I have felt that a certain
explanation is due to the public regarding
Tish’s great picture, The Sky Pirate,
especially as to the alteration at the end of that
now celebrated picture. I have also felt that a full
explanation of what happened to us on that final
tragic night is due to our dear Tish herself.
She has never yet made a statement of any case of
hers, believing that her deeds must speak for her.</p>

<p>But perhaps, more than anything, I am influenced
by the desire to present the facts to Charlie
Sands, Tish’s nephew, for, owing to his attitude
the day he met us at the train, Tish has never
deigned to make a full explanation.</p>

<p>We were on the platform, and I was taking a
cinder out of Aggie’s eye, when we perceived him,
standing close by and surveying us gloomily.</p>

<p>“My life,” he said, “has resolved itself into
meeting you three when you have come back from
doing something you shouldn’t.” He then picked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
up a bag or two and observed: “Even the chap in
the Bible only had one prodigal.”</p>

<p>He said nothing more until we were waiting for
a taxi, when he observed that his nerves were not
what they had been, and who was to secure bail
for us when he was gone? We could only meet
this with silence, but the fact is that he has
never yet lost his money in that way, and never
will.</p>

<p>“Some day,” he said, “I shall drop over of heart
failure on receiving one of your wires, and then
where will you be?”</p>

<p>“The circumstances were unusual,” Tish said
with dignity.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world they were!” he said. “Unusual
as h—l.”</p>

<p>He then lapsed into silence, and so remained
until we were in the taxicab, on our way to Tish’s
apartment. Then he leaned forward and stared
fixedly at his Aunt Letitia.</p>

<p>“Now!” he said. “We’re going to have the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
What about that elephant?”</p>

<p>Tish raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Elephant?” she said.</p>

<p>“‘Elephant’ is the word I used. Look me
square in the eye, last surviving female relative of
mine, and deny you had anything to do with it!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
The moment the Associated Press wires began to
come in, I knew.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” Tish said acidly. “If you know,
there is no need to explain.”</p>

<p>And from that moment to this, she never has.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In order to bring the elephant incident in its
proper sequence it is necessary to return to the
autumn of last year, and to tell of the various
incidents which led up to that awful night, and
the roof of the First National Bank of Los
Angeles.</p>

<p>During all of last winter Tish had been making
a survey of what she called the art, the educational
value and the business of moving pictures.
She was, in a word, studying them. And she came
to certain conclusions. Thus, she believed that
the public had wearied of sentiment and was ready
for adventure without sex. Also, that the overemphasis
on love in the pictures was weakening
the moral fiber of the nations.</p>

<p>“It was when sex replaced war,” she observed
to Aggie and myself, “that Rome fell and Babylon
crumbled to the dust.”</p>

<p>I agreed with her, but Aggie had certain reservations.
When, as frequently happened, Tish
left the theater just before the final embrace, thus
registering her disapproval, Aggie sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
loitered, to put on her overshoes or to find her
glasses. Indeed, once trying to take her departure
while looking back over her shoulder, she had
a really bad fall in the theater aisle.</p>

<p>But our dear Tish showed Aggie considerable
indulgence, as Aggie’s life had at one time held a
romance of its own, she having been engaged to
a Mr. Wiggins, who had not survived the engagement.</p>

<p>I have mentioned Mr. Wiggins because, although
it is thirty years since he passed over, it
was Aggie’s getting into touch with him in the
spirit world which brought Mr. Stein into our
lives. And it was Stein who brought about all our
troubles. We were both very happy to find our
dear Tish occupied with a new interest, as since
the war, when she had captured the town of X——
single handed—for Aggie was at the time on the
church steeple and I had gone back for reënforcements—she
had become rather listless.</p>

<p>“I find it difficult,” she had once acknowledged,
“to substitute the daily dozen for my activities in
France, and the sight of four women quarreling
madly over a bridge table for a back scratcher
with a pink bow on it simply makes me homesick
for the war.”</p>

<p>Judge of our disappointment, therefore, when
with the first of March, Tish’s interest in the pictures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
apparently lagged. From spending night
after night watching them, she suddenly became
invisible to us for long periods, and Hannah reported
that at these times she would lock herself
in her room, burning innumerable papers at the
end of the period of seclusion. Also that, listening
at the door, she could hear our dear Tish walking
up and down the floor muttering to herself;
and she reported that these active periods were
followed by quiescent ones, when she could hear
the rapid scratching of a pen.</p>

<p>Our first anxiety was that Tish had got herself
into some sort of difficulty with her affairs, and
this was not lessened by Hannah’s bringing to
us one evening a scrap of charred paper on which
were the words: “I will kill myself first.”</p>

<p>Had Charlie Sands not been out of town we
would have gone to him, but he was in Europe,
and did not return until four months later, when
we were able to call on him for bail, as I have
said. We had, therefore, no inkling of what was
happening when, finding Tish in an approachable
mood one evening, Aggie suggested that she try
automatic writing.</p>

<p>Aggie had at last got into touch with Mr.
Wiggins through a medium, and learned that he
was very happy. But, although I have seen her
sit for hours with a pencil poised over a sheet of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
paper, she had secured no written message from
him. She therefore suggested that Tish try it.</p>

<p>“I’ve always felt that you are psychic, Tish,”
she said. “Every now and then when I touch
you I get a spark, like electricity. And I have
frequently heard knocks on the furniture when
you are in a dark room.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got bruises to show for them too,” Tish
said grimly.</p>

<p>Well, though Tish at first demurred, she finally
agreed, and after Aggie had placed a red petticoat
over the lamp to secure what she called the psychic
light, Tish made the attempt.</p>

<p>“I have no faith in it,” she said, “but I shall
entirely retire my personality, and if there is a
current from beyond, it shall flow through me
unimpeded.”</p>

<p>Very soon we heard the pencil moving, and on
turning on the light later we were electrified to
see the rough outline of an animal, which Aggie
has since contended might have been intended for
Katie, the elephant, but which closely resembled
those attempts frequently made to draw a pig
with the eyes closed. Underneath was the word
“stein.”</p>

<p>In view of later developments we know now
that the word “stein” was not from Mr. Wiggins—although
Aggie remembered that he had once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
or twice referred, when thirsty, to a stein of something
or other—but that it was a proper name.</p>

<p>That at least a part of the message had a meaning
for our dear Tish is shown by a cryptic remark
she made to the room.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” she said, to whatever spirit hovered
about us. “I’ll do it. It was what I intended,
anyhow.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Just a month later Tish telephoned one morning
for Aggie and myself to go there that afternoon.
There was a touch of sharpness in her
manner, which with Tish usually means nervous
tension.</p>

<p>“And put on something decent, for once,” she
said. “There’s no need to look as though you
were taking your old clothes for an airing, to
keep out the moths.”</p>

<p>Tish was alone when we arrived. I could smell
sponge cakes baking, and Tish had put on her
mother’s onyx set and was sitting with her back
to the light. She looked slightly feverish, and I
commented on it, but she only said that she had
been near the stove.</p>

<p>When she was called out, however, Aggie
leaned over to me.</p>

<p>“Stove, nothing!” she said. “She’s painted her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
face! And she’s got a new transformation!”</p>

<p>Had Charlie Sands himself appeared wearing
a toupee we could not have been more astounded.
And our amazement continued when Hannah
brought in a tea tray with the Carberry silver on
it, silver which had been in a safe-deposit vault
for twenty years.</p>

<p>“Hannah,” I demanded, “what is the matter?”</p>

<p>“She’s going to be married! That’s what,”
said Hannah, putting down the tray with a slam.
“No fool like an old fool!” Then she burst into
tears. “She spent the whole morning in a beauty
parlor,” she wailed. “Look at her finger nails!
And callin’ me in to draw up her corset on her!”</p>

<p>Neither Aggie nor I could speak for a moment.
As I have said, our dear Tish had never shown
any interest in the other sex. Indeed, I think I
may say that Tish’s virginity of outlook regarding
herself is her strongest characteristic. It is
her proud boast that no man has ever offered her
the most chaste of salutes, and her simple statement
as to what would happen if one did has
always been a model of firmness.</p>

<p>I have heard her remark that when the late
Henry Clay observed “Give me liberty or give me
death,” he was referring to marriage.</p>

<p>But Aggie had been correct. There was a
bloom on dear Tish’s face never placed there by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
the benign hand of Nature. Had I seen Mr.
Ostermaier, our minister, preaching a sermon in
a silk hat I should not have felt more horrified.
And our anxiety was not lessened by Tish’s first
remark when she returned.</p>

<p>“I shall want you two as witnesses,” she said.
“And I shall make just one remark now. I know
your attitude on certain subjects, so I ask you
simply to remember this: I believe we owe a
duty to the nation, especially with regard to
children.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, Tish!” Aggie said, and turned
a sort of greenish white. “A woman of your
age——”</p>

<p>“What’s my age got to do with it?” Tish
snapped. “I simply say——”</p>

<p>But just then the doorbell rang, and Hannah
announced a gentleman.</p>

<p>It was a Mr. Stein.</p>

<p>Aggie has told me since that the thought of Tish
marrying was as nothing to her then, compared
with the belief that she was marrying out of the
Presbyterian Church. And she knew the moment
she saw him that Mr. Stein was not a Presbyterian.
But as it developed and as all the world
knows now, it was not a matter of marriage at all.</p>

<p>Mr. Stein was the well-known moving-picture
producer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>While Aggie and I were endeavoring to readjust
our ideas he sat down, and looked at Tish
while rubbing his hands together.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Carberry,” he said, “I’ve brought
the contracts.”</p>

<p>“And the advance?” Tish inquired calmly.</p>

<p>“And the advance. Certified check, as you requested.”</p>

<p>“You approve of my idea?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “you’re right in one way. Sex
has been overdone in pictures. The censors have
killed it. When you’re limited to a five-foot kiss—well,
you know. You can’t get it over, that’s
all. We’ve had to fall back on adventure. Not
even crime, at that. Would you believe it, we’ve
had to change a murder scene just lately to the
corpse taking an overdose of sleeping medicine
by mistake. And we can’t have a woman show
her figure on a chaise longue in a tea gown, while
the bathing-suit people get by without any trouble.
It’s criminal, that’s all. Criminal!”</p>

<p>“You have missed my idea,” Tish said coldly.
“I wrote that picture to prove that a love interest,
any love interest, is not essential to a picture.”</p>

<p>He agreed with what we now realize was suspicious
alacrity.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he said. “Certainly! After all,
who pays the profits on pictures? The women,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Miss Carberry. The women! Do up the dishes
in a hurry—get me?—and beat it for the theater.
Like to sit there and imagine themselves
the heroine. And up to now we’ve never
given them a heroine over seventeen years of
age!”</p>

<p>He reflected on this, almost tearfully.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “that’s over now. There are
twenty-nine million women over forty in America
to-day, and every one will see this picture. That
is, if we do it.”</p>

<p>“If you do it?” Tish inquired, gazing at him
through her spectacles.</p>

<p>“When I told the casting director to find me a
woman for the part he went out and got drunk.
He’s hardly been sober since.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t found anyone?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>Tish had picked up her knitting, and Mr. Stein
sat back and surveyed her for a few moments in
silence. Then he leaned forward.</p>

<p>“Excuse me for asking, Miss Carberry,” he
said, “but have you ever driven a car?”</p>

<p>“I drove an ambulance in France.”</p>

<p>“Really?” He seemed interested and slightly
excited. “Then the sound of a gun wouldn’t scare
you, I dare say?”</p>

<p>“I would hardly say that. I shoot very well.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
I’m considered rather good with a machine gun,
I believe.”</p>

<p>He sat forward on the edge of his chair, and
stared at her.</p>

<p>“Ever ride a horse?” he inquired. “Not hard,
you know, with a Western saddle. You just sit in
it and the horse does the rest.”</p>

<p>Tish looked at him through her spectacles.</p>

<p>“There is no argument for the Western saddle
as against the English,” she said firmly. “I have
used them both, Mr. Stein. One rides properly
by balance, not adherence.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stein suddenly got out his handkerchief
and wiped his forehead.</p>

<p>“Would you believe it!” he muttered. “And me
just happening to be in town on a little matter of
alimony! Does everything! By heaven, I believe
she could fill a tooth!”</p>

<p>He then stared again at Tish and said, “You’re
not by any chance related to the Miss Carberry
who captured the town of X—— from the Germans,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“My friends here, and I, did that; yes.”</p>

<p>He stared at us all without saying anything for
a moment. Then he moistened his lips.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” he said. “Well, well! Why, we
ran a shot of you, Miss Carberry, in our news
feature, when you were decorated and kissed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
by that French general, What’s-His-Name.”</p>

<p>“I prefer not to recall that.”</p>

<p>“Surely, surely,” he agreed. He then got up
and bowed to Tish. “Miss Carberry,” he said,
“I apologize, and I salute you. I came here to
offer you a fixed price for your story. A moment
ago I decided to offer you the part of the
woman of—er—maturity in your picture, with
two hundred dollars a week and a double
for the stunts. I now remove the double,
and offered you a thousand a week for your
first picture. If that goes, we’ll talk business.”</p>

<p>If Tish reads this I will ask her at this moment
to pause and think. Did I or did I not enter a
protest? Did Aggie warn her or did she not?
And was it not Tish herself who silenced us with
a gesture, and completed her arrangements while
Aggie softly wept?</p>

<p>She cannot deny it.</p>

<p>One final word of Tish’s I must record, in fairness
to her.</p>

<p>“If I do this, Mr. Stein,” she said, “there must
be a clear understanding. This is purely a picture
of adventure and is to teach a real moral
lesson.”</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” Mr. Stein said heartily. “Virtue
is always triumphant on the screen. It is our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
greatest commercial asset. Without it, ladies, we
would be nowhere.”</p>

<p>“And there must be no love element introduced.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” said Mr. Stein. “Certainly
not!”</p>

<p>Those were almost his final words. We then
had tea, and Tish gave him some of our homemade
blackberry cordial. He seemed very pleased
with it, and on departing remarked, “My admiration
for you grows steadily, Miss Carberry. I
did not fully estimate your powers when I said
you could fill a tooth. You could, with that
cordial, make a ouija board hiccup.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Things were quiet for a month or two after
that, and we understood that the production was
being got ready. But Tish was very busy, having
thrown herself into her preparations with her
usual thoroughness.</p>

<p>She had found a teacher who taught how to
register with the face the various emotions on the
screen, and twice a week Aggie or myself held
her book, illustrated with cuts, while Tish registered
in alphabetical order: Amusement, anxiety,
boredom, curiosity, devotion, envy, fatigue, generosity,
hate, interest, jealousy, keenness, laughter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
love, merriment, nobility, objection, pity, quarrelsomeness,
ridicule, satisfaction, terror, uneasiness,
vanity, wrath, and so on.</p>

<p>I must confess that the subtle changes of expression
were often lost on me, and that I suffered
extremely at those times, when discarding the
book, she asked us to name her emotion from her
expression. She would stand before her mirror
and arrange her features carefully, and then
quickly turn. But I am no physiognomist.</p>

<p>Her physical preparations, however, she made
alone. That she was practicing again with her
revolver Hannah felt sure, but we had no idea
where and how. As has been previously recorded,
the janitor of her apartment had refused
to allow her to shoot in the basement after a bullet
had embedded itself in the dining table of A flat
while the family was at luncheon. We surmised
that she was doing it somewhere outside of town.</p>

<p>Later on we had proof of this. Aggie and I
were taking a constitutional one day in the country
beyond the car line when, greatly to our surprise,
we heard two shots beyond a hedge, followed by a
man’s angry shouts, and on looking over the hedge,
who should we behold but our splendid Tish,
revolver in hand, and confronted by an angry
farm laborer.</p>

<p>“Right through my hat!” he was bellowing. “If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
a man can’t do an honest day’s work without being
fired at——”</p>

<p>“Work?” Tish said coldly. “You were so still
I took you for a scarecrow.”</p>

<p>“Scarecrow yourself! When I yelled, you shot
again!” he howled. “Deliberate attempt at murder.
That’s what it was.”</p>

<p>“It went off by itself the second time,” Tish explained.
“I’m rehearsing a certain scene, and——”</p>

<p>“Rehearsing?” said the man. “What for?”</p>

<p>“For the moving pictures.”</p>

<p>He looked at her, and then he bowed very
politely.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” he said. “I didn’t recognize you
at first, Miss Pickford. And how’s Doug?”</p>

<p>We did not tell Tish that we had witnessed this
encounter. She might have been sensitive about
mistaking a farmer for a scarecrow.</p>

<p>It was a day or so after, in our presence, that
Tish informed Hannah she would take her along
as her maid. And Hannah, who in twenty odd
years had never been known to show
enthusiasm, was plainly delighted with the prospect.</p>

<p>“D’you mean I can see them acting?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“I imagine so,” Tish said with a tolerant smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>“Love scenes too?” Hannah asked, with an indelicacy
that startled us.</p>

<p>“There will be no love scenes in this picture,
Hannah,” Tish reproved her. “I am surprised at
you. And even in the ones you see every evening,
when you ought to be doing something better, it
is as well to remember that the persons are not
really lovers. Indeed, that often they are barely
friends.”</p>

<p>She then told Hannah to go downtown and buy
a book on moving-picture make-up and the various
articles required, as, since she was to be a personal
maid, she must know about such things.</p>

<p>I confess that Aggie and I were in a state of
extreme depression when we left Tish that day.
The thought of our dear friend altering the face
her Creator gave her was a painful one, and both
of us, I think, feared it as an index of a possible
general demoralization, as too often happens in
the movies. Aggie particularly feared the contacts
with men, as mentioned by Hannah, in spite
of Tish’s firm attitude. The well-known temptations
of Hollywood were in both our minds.</p>

<p>“They aren’t paying her a thousand dollars a
week just to ride, and so on,” Aggie said bitterly.
“Did you ever see a picture without a love story?
It isn’t only her neck she’s risking, Lizzie.”</p>

<p>I must confess to the same uneasiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>We went to bed early that night, sorely troubled,
and I had fallen asleep and was dreaming that
Tish was trying to leap from an automobile to a
moving train, and that everytime she did it the
train jumped to another track, when the telephone
bell rang, and it was Hannah. She said
that Tish wanted me, and to go over right away,
but not to waken Aggie.</p>

<p>I went at once and found all the lights going,
and Tish in her bed, bolt upright, with both eyes
closed.</p>

<p>“Tish!” I cried. “Your eyes! Can’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Not through my eyelids,” she said witheringly.
“Don’t be a fool, Lizzie. Look at this stuff and
then tell me what will take it off.”</p>

<p>I then saw that the rims of her eyelids were
smeared with a black paste which had hardened
like enamel, and that they had become glued together,
leaving her, temporarily at least, sightless
and helpless. My poor Tish!</p>

<p>“What will take it off?” she demanded. “That
idiot Hannah offered to melt it with a burning
match.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think anything but a hammer will do
any good, Tish.”</p>

<p>I discovered then that Hannah had bought the
make-up book, and that it laid particular emphasis
on beading the eyelashes. With her impatient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
temperament Tish, although the shops were shut
by that time, decided to make the experiment, and
had concocted a paste of glue and India ink. She
had experimented first on her eyebrows, she had
thought successfully, although when I saw her
they looked like two jet crescents fastened to her
forehead; but inadvertently closing her eyes after
beading her lashes, she had been unable to open
them again.</p>

<p>She and Hannah had tried various expedients,
among them lard, the yolk of an egg, cold cream
and ammonia, but without result. I was obliged
to tell her that it was set like a cement pavement.</p>

<p>In the end I was able, amid exclamations of
pain and annoyance from Tish, to cut off her
lashes, and later to shave her eyebrows with an
old razor which Hannah had for some unknown
purpose, and although much of the glue remained
Tish was able to see once more. When I left her
she was contemplating her image in her mirror,
and a little of her fine frenzy of early enthusiasm
seemed to have departed.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of Tish that, once embarked
on an enterprise, she devotes her entire attention
to it and becomes in a way isolated from her kind.
Her mental attitude during these periods of what
may be termed mind gestation is absent and solitary.
Thus I am able to tell little of what preparations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
she made during the following weeks. I
do know that she went to church on her last Sunday
with her bonnet wrong side before, and that
during the sermon she was unconsciously assuming
the various facial expressions, one after the
other, to the astonishment and confusion of Mr.
Ostermaier in the pulpit.</p>

<p>But we also learned that she had again taken
up her riding. The papers one evening were full
of an incident connected with the local hunt, where
an unknown woman rider had followed the hounds
in to the death and had then driven them all off
and let the fox go free.</p>

<p>My suspicions were at once aroused, and I
carried the paper to Tish that night. I found her
on her sofa, with the air redolent of arnica and
witch hazel, and gave her the paper. She read
the article calmly enough.</p>

<p>“I belong to the Humane Society, Lizzie,” she
said. “Those dogs would have killed it.”</p>

<p>“But what made you join the hunt?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t join the hunt,” she said wearily.
“How did I know that beast was an old hunter?
I was riding along quietly when a horn blew somewhere,
and the creature just went over the fence
and started.” Tish closed her eyes. “We jumped
eleven fences and four ditches,” she said in a
tired voice, “and I bit my tongue halfway through.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
I think we went through some hotbeds, too, but
I hadn’t time to look.”</p>

<p>“Tish,” I said firmly, “I want you to think, long
and hard. Is it worth it? What are they going
to pay you a thousand dollars a week to risk?
Your beauty, your virtue or your neck? I leave
it to you to guess.”</p>

<p>“It’s my neck,” said Tish coldly.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve lost the head that belongs on it,”
I retorted. And I went home.</p>

<p>We were to leave on a Monday, and the Saturday
before Tish called me by telephone.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking, Lizzie,” she said. “A
portion of my picture is laid in the desert. We’d
better take some antisnake-bite serum.”</p>

<p>“Where do you get it?”</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, don’t bother me with detail,”
she snapped. “Try the snake house at the
Zoo.”</p>

<p>I did so, and I must say the man acted strangely
about it.</p>

<p>“For snake bite?” he inquired. “Who’s been
bitten?”</p>

<p>“Nobody’s been bitten,” I said with dignity.
“I just want a little to have on hand in case of
trouble.”</p>

<p>He looked around and lowered his voice. “I
get you,” he said. “Well, I haven’t any now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
but I will have next week. Eight dollars a quart.
Prewar stuff.”</p>

<p>When I told him I couldn’t wait he stared at me
strangely, and when I turned at the door he had
called another man, and they were both looking
after me and shaking their heads.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It had been the desire of Tish’s life to fly in an
aëroplane, and we knew by this time that much
of her story was laid in the air. But during the
trip west I believe she lost some of her fine
enthusiasm. This was due, I imagine, to the repeated
stories of crashes with which the newspapers
were filled, and also to the fact that we
passed one airship abandoned in a field, and showing
signs of having fallen from a considerable
height.</p>

<p>This theory was borne out, I admit, by Tish’s
reception of Mr. Stein at the station in Los
Angeles.</p>

<p>“We’ve got a small dirigible for the bootleggers,
Miss Carberry,” he said cheerfully, “and
a fast pursuit plane for you, machine gun and all.
Got the plane cheap, after a crash. A dollar
saved is a dollar earned, you know!”</p>

<p>Tish, I thought, went a trifle pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“You won’t need them, Mr. Stein. I’m going
to take the story out of the air.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! What for?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“It is too improbable.”</p>

<p>“Improbable! Of course it is. That’s the
point.” Then he leaned forward and patted her
reassuringly. “Now, see here, Miss Carberry,”
he said, “don’t you worry! We’ve got a good
pilot for you, and everything. You’re as safe
there as you are in this car.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately the car at that moment failed to
make a sharp turn, left the road, leaped a ditch,
and brought up in a plowed field. It seemed a bad
omen to begin with, and Tish, I think, so considered
it.</p>

<p>“My nephew developed jaundice after an air
ride, Mr. Stein,” she said as the driver backed the
car onto the road, and we pulled Aggie from beneath
the three of us. “An attack of jaundice on
my part would hold up the picture indefinitely.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Stein was ready for that, as we later
found him ready for every emergency.</p>

<p>“We’ve a doctor on the lot, Miss Carberry,”
he said. “Specializes in jaundice. Don’t you
worry at all.”</p>

<p>Looking back, both Aggie and I realize the
significance of the remark he made on leaving us
after having settled us at the hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“We’ve made one or two changes in the story,
Miss Carberry,” he said. “Nothing you will
object to.” He smiled genially. “Have to give
the scenario department something to do to earn
their salaries!”</p>

<p>Had Tish not been preoccupied this would not
have gone unchallenged. But she was staring up
just then at the blue California sky, where an
aviator was looping the loop, and so forth, and
she made no comment.</p>

<p>When we recall our California experience,
Aggie and I date our first disappointment from
the following day, Tish’s first at the studio.</p>

<p>Though Tish cannot be termed a handsome
woman, she has a certain majesty of mien, which
has its own charm. Her new transformation, too,
had softened certain of her facial angles, and we
had felt that she would have real distinction on the
screen. But it was to be otherwise, alas!</p>

<p>Aggie and I had been put out, and sat on the
dressing-room steps, perspiring freely, while numerous
people came and went from Tish’s room.
We had heard of the great change effected by the
make-up, and our hopes were high. We had not
expected her to compete with the various beauties
of the silver sheet, but we had expected to find her
natural charms emphasized.</p>

<p>But when, some time later, the door opened and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Tish appeared, what shall I say? It was Tish, of
course, but Tish in an old skirt and a blouse, with
no transformation, and her own hair slicked into a
hard knot on top of her head.</p>

<p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and she can
never be utterly plain to us. But I must say she
was not ornamental.</p>

<p>She did not speak, nor did we. She simply
passed us, stalking across the lot to a large glassed-in
building, and I went in to comfort Hannah.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The picture, The Sky Pirate, having made a
great success, I need only briefly outline Tish’s
story. As an elderly clerk in the secret service,
she is appalled by the amount of rum smuggling
going on, especially by dirigible from Mexico.
She volunteers to stop it, and is refused permission.
She then steals an airship from the Army,
funds from the Treasury in Washington, an air
pilot from the Marines, and starts West, unheralded
and unsung, in pursuit of her laudable
purpose.</p>

<p>The various incidents, as the great American
public will recall, include her fastening a Mexican
governor in a cave by exploding dynamite in the
hillside above him; dropping from a bridge to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
moving train below to search the express car for
liquor; trapping the chief smuggler on top of the
structural-iron framework of a building, and so
on. In the end, by holding up the smugglers’
dirigible with her own aëroplane and a machine
gun, Tish forces them to hand over the valise containing
their ill-gotten gains, and with it descends
by a parachute to the ground and safety. Later
on, as you will recall, she finds the smugglers at
an orgy, and with two revolvers arrests them all.</p>

<p>This simple outline only barely reveals the plan
of the story. It says nothing of the pursuits on
horseback, the shipwreck, the fire, and so on. But
it shows clearly that the original story contained
no love interest.</p>

<p>I lay stress on this at this point in the narration,
because it was very early in the picture that we
began to notice Mr. Macmanus.</p>

<p>Mr. Macmanus was a tall gentleman with a
gray mustache, and with a vague resemblance to
Mr. Ostermaier, but lacking the latter’s saintliness
of expression. We paid little attention to him at
first, but he was always around when Tish was
being photographed—or shot, as the technical
term is—and in his make-up.</p>

<p>Aggie rather admired him, and spoke to him
one day while he was feeding peanuts to Katie, the
tame studio elephant—of whom more anon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“Are you being shot to-day?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“No madam. Not to-day, nor even at sunrise!”
he replied in a bitter tone. “From what I can discover,
I am being paid my salary to prevent my
appearance on any screen.”</p>

<p>He then gloomily fed the empty bag to Katie,
and went away.</p>

<p>We had no solution for the mystery of Mr.
Macmanus at that period, and indeed temporarily
forgot him. For the time had come for Tish to
take the air, and both Aggie and I were very
nervous.</p>

<p>Even Tish herself toyed with her breakfast the
morning of that day, and spoke touchingly of
Charlie Sands, observing that she was his only
surviving relative, and that perhaps it was wrong
and selfish of her to take certain risks. To add to
our anxiety, the morning paper chronicled the
story of a fatal crash the day before, and she went,
I think, a trifle pale. Later on, however, she rallied
superbly.</p>

<p>“After all,” she said, “the percentage of accident
is only one in five hundred. I am sorry for
the poor wretch, but it saves the lives of four
hundred and ninety-nine others. Figures do not
lie.”</p>

<p>From that time on she was quite buoyant, and
ate a lamb chop with appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>During the flight Aggie, Hannah and I remained
in the open, looking up, and I must admit
that it was a nervous time for us, seeing our dear
Tish head down above the earth, and engaged in
other life-imperiling exploits. But she came down
smiling and, when the aëroplane stopped, spoke
cheerfully.</p>

<p>“A marvelous experience,” she observed.
“One feels akin to the birds. One soars, and loses
memory of earth.”</p>

<p>She was then helped out, but owing to the recent
altitude her knees refused to support her, and she
sank to the ground.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>There were, of course, occasional misadventures.
There was that terrible day, for instance,
when Tish hung from a bridge by her hands,
ready to drop to a train beneath, when through
some mistake the train was switched to another
track and our dear Letitia was left hanging, like
Mohammed’s coffin, between heaven and earth.
And that other day, of wretched memory, when
on exploding the hillside to imprison the governor,
a large stone flew up and struck Aggie violently
in the mouth, dislodging her upper plate and
almost strangling her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>There was, again, the time when the smugglers
set fire to the building Tish was in, and the fire
department did not receive its signal and failed to
arrive until almost too late.</p>

<p>But in the main, things went very well. There
were peaceful days when Aggie and I fed peanuts
to the little studio elephant, Katie, and indeed became
quite friendly with Katie, who dragged certain
heavy articles about the lot and often roamed
at will, her harness chains dangling. And there
were hot days when we sought the shelter of the
cool hangar which housed the smugglers’ dirigible,
or baby blimp as it was called, and where we had
concealed several bottles of blackberry cordial
against emergency.</p>

<p>At such times we frequently discussed what
Aggie now termed the Macmanus mystery. For
such it had become.</p>

<p>“He’s not hanging around for any good purpose,
Lizzie,” Aggie frequently observed. “He’s
in Tish’s picture somehow, and—I think he is a
lover!”</p>

<p>We had not mentioned him to Tish, but on the
next day after she took her parachute leap we
learned that she had her own suspicions about him.</p>

<p>I may say here, before continuing with my narrative,
that Tish’s parachute experience was without
accident, although not without incident. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
was to leap with the bag of stage money she had
captured in the air from the smugglers, and this
she did. But a gust of wind caught her, and it
was our painful experience to see her lifted on the
gale and blown out of sight toward the mountains.</p>

<p>Several automobiles and the dirigible immediately
started after her, but dusk fell and she had
not returned to us. Even now I cannot picture
those waiting hours without emotion. At one
moment we visualized her sitting on some lonely
mountain crag, and at another still floating on,
perhaps indefinitely, a lonely bit of flotsam at the
mercy of the elements.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock that night, however, she returned,
slightly irritable but unhurt.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, Aggie,” she said briskly,
“stop sneezing and crying, and order me some
supper. I’ve been sitting in a ranch house, with a
nervous woman pointing a gun at me, for three
hours.”</p>

<p>It developed that she had landed in the country,
and had untied the parachute and started with her
valise full of stage money back toward the studio,
but that she had stopped to ask for supper at a
ranch, and the woman there had looked in the bag
while Tish was washing, and had taken her for a
bank robber.</p>

<p>“If she had ever looked away,” Tish said, “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
could have grabbed the gun. But she was cross-eyed,
and I don’t know yet which eye she watched
with.”</p>

<p>As I have said, it was the next day that we
learned that Tish herself had grown suspicious
about Mr. Macmanus.</p>

<p>She sent for us to come to her dressing room,
and when we appeared she said, “I want you both
here for a few minutes. Light a cigarette, Hannah.
Mr. Stein’s coming.”</p>

<p>To our horror Hannah produced a box of
cigarettes and lighted one by holding it in the
flame of a match. But we were relieved to find
that Tish did not intend to smoke it. Hannah
placed it in an ash tray on the table and left it
there.</p>

<p>“Local color,” Tish said laconically. “They
think a woman’s queer here if she doesn’t smoke.
Come in, Mr. Stein.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Stein entered he was uneasy, we
thought, but he wore his usual smile.</p>

<p>“Going like a breeze, Miss Carberry,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tish grimly. “And so am I!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, going?” said Mr. Stein,
slightly changing color. “You can’t quit on us,
Miss Carberry. We’ve spent a quarter of a
million dollars already.”</p>

<p>“And I’ve risked a million-dollar life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“We’ve been carrying insurance on you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you have!” said Tish, and eyed him coldly.
“I hope you’ve got Mr. Macmanus insured too.”</p>

<p>“Just why Mr. Macmanus, Miss Carberry?”</p>

<p>“Because,” Tish said with her usual candor, “I
propose physical assault, and possibly murder, if
he’s brought on the set with me.”</p>

<p>“Now see here,” he said soothingly, “you’re
just tired, Miss Carberry. Ladies, how about a
glass of that homemade TNT for Miss Tish?
And a little all round?”</p>

<p>But when none of us moved he was forced to
state his case, as he called it.</p>

<p>“You see, Miss Carberry,” he said, “we’ve made
the old girl pretty hardboiled, so far. Now the
public’s going to want to see her softer side.”</p>

<p>“As, for instance?”</p>

<p>“Well, something like this: The rancher who’s
been the secret head of the smugglers, he’s a
decent fellow at heart, see? Only got into it to
pay the mortgage on the old home. Well, now,
why not a bit of sentiment between you and him
at the end? Nothing splashy, just a nice refined
church and a kiss.” When he saw Tish’s face he
went on, speaking very fast. “Not more than a
four-foot kiss, if that. We’ve got to do it, Miss
Carberry. I’ve been wiring our houses all over
the country, and they’re unanimous.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>At Tish’s firm refusal he grew almost tearful,
saying he dared not fly in the face of tradition,
and that he couldn’t even book the picture if he
did. But Tish merely rose majestically and
opened the door.</p>

<p>“I warned you, Mr. Stein, I would have no sex
stuff in this picture.”</p>

<p>“Sex stuff!” he cried. “Good Lord, you don’t
call that sex stuff, do you?”</p>

<p>“I dare say you call it platonic friendship here,”
Tish said in her coldest tone. “But my agreement
stands. Good afternoon.”</p>

<p>He went out, muttering.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Just what happened within a day or two to
determine Tish’s later course, I cannot say. We
know that she had a long talk with Mr. Macmanus
himself, and that he maintained that his intentions
were of the most honorable—namely, to earn
a small salary—and that his idea was that the
final embrace could be limited to his kissing her
hand.</p>

<p>“I have ventured so to suggest, madam,”
Hannah reported him as saying, “but they care
nothing for art here. Nothing. They reduce
everything to its physical plane, absolutely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>That our dear Tish was in a trap evidently became
increasingly clear to her as the next few
days passed. Nothing else would have forced her
to the immediate course she pursued, and which
resulted in such ignominious failure.</p>

<p>It was, I believe, a week after the interview
with Mr. Stein, and with the picture drawing
rapidly to a close, that Tish retired early one night
and was inaccessible to us.</p>

<p>We were entirely unsuspicious, as the day had
been a hard one, Tish having been washed from
her horse while crossing a stream and having
sunk twice before they stopped shooting the picture
to rescue her.</p>

<p>Aggie, I remember, was remarking that after
all Macmanus was a handsome man, and that some
people wouldn’t object to being embraced by him
at a thousand dollars a week, when Hannah came
bolting in.</p>

<p>“She’s gone!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Gone? Who’s gone?”</p>

<p>“Miss Tish. Her room’s empty and I can’t
find her valise.”</p>

<p>Only partially attired we rushed along the corridor.
Hannah had been only too right. Our
dear Tish had flown.</p>

<p>I did not then, nor do I now, admit that this
flight, and the other which followed it, indicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
any weakness in Letitia Carberry. The strongest
characters must now and then face situations too
strong for them and depart, as the poet says, “to
fight another day.”</p>

<p>I do, however, question the wisdom of her
course, for it put her enemies on guard and involved
us finally in most unhappy circumstances.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, we had closed Tish’s door on
its emptiness and were about to depart, when on
turning she herself stood before us!</p>

<p>She said nothing. She simply passed on and
into the room, traveling bag in hand, and closed
and locked the door between us.</p>

<p>We believe now that her flight was not unexpected,
and that her door and windows had been
under surveillance. Certainly she was met at the
station by Mr. Stein and his attorney and was
forced to turn back, under threat of such legal
penalties as we know not of. Certainly, too, she
had closed that avenue of escape to further attempts,
and knew it.</p>

<p>But from Tish herself we have until now had
no confidences.</p>

<p>Some slight revenge she had, we know, the
following day. As this portion of the picture has
received very good notices, it may interest the
reader to know under what circumstances it was
taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>I have mentioned the scene in the studio where
the smugglers were banqueting, and Tish, followed
by revenue officers, was to appear and, after a
shot or two, force them to subjection. Aggie and
I had been permitted to watch this, the crowning
scene of the picture, and stood behind the camera.
The musicians were playing For He’s a Jolly Good
Fellow, and the rum runners were drinking cold
tea in champagne glasses and getting very drunk
over it, when Tish entered.</p>

<p>Aggie took one look at her and clutched my arm.</p>

<p>“I don’t like her expression, Lizzie,” she whispered.
“She——”</p>

<p>At that moment Tish fired, and the bandit who’d
been standing gave a loud bellow. She had shot his
wine glass out of his hand.</p>

<p>“Stop the camera!” the chief smuggler called
in a loud voice. “She’s crazy! She’s got that
gun loaded!”</p>

<p>The director, however, seemed delighted, and
called to the camera men to keep on grinding.</p>

<p>“Great stuff, Miss Carberry!” he yelled. “I
didn’t think anybody could put life in these
wooden soldiers, but you have. Keep it up, only
don’t kill anyone. Hold it, everybody! Camera!
Camera! Now shoot out the lights, Miss Carberry,
and I’ll think up something to follow while
you’re doing it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>I believe now that he referred to the candles on
the table, but Tish either did not or would not
understand. A second later there were two
crashes of broken glass, and wild howls from the
men with the arc lamps above, which lighted the
scene. The stage was in semidarkness, and pieces
of glass and metal and the most frightful language
continued to drop from above. In the confusion
all I could hear was the director muttering something
about five hundred dollars gone to perdition,
and the rush of the entire company from the stage.</p>

<p>It has been no surprise to me that this scene has
made the great hit of the picture, the critics
describing it as a classical study in fear. It was,
indeed.</p>

<p>This small explosion of indignation had one
good effect, however. Tish was almost her own
self that night, recalling with a certain humor that
a piece of one arc lamp had fallen down and had
hit Mr. Macmanus on the head.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Tish is the most open and candid of women, and
nothing so rouses her indignation as trickery.
Had Mr. Stein not resorted to stratagem to compel
her consent to the final scenes, I believe a
compromise might have been effected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>It was his deliberate attempt to imprison Tish
on the lot the night before those final shots which
brought about the catastrophe. To pretend, as he
does now, that he thought we had left at midnight
does not absolve him.</p>

<p>The fact remains that after the final night shots,
when Tish had her make-up off and we started to
leave, we found that the gates were locked and the
gatekeeper gone. What is more, there was a man
across the street behind a tree box, watching the
exit.</p>

<p>Tish called to him in an angry voice, but he
pretended not to be there, and we finally turned
away.</p>

<p>From the beginning Tish had recognized it as
a trick, and she lost but little time in organizing
herself for escape. A trial of the high fence which
surrounded the lot, with Aggie on Tish’s shoulders
while Tish stood on a box, revealed three strands
of heavy barbed wire. But, more than that,
Aggie declared that there were guards here and
there all around.</p>

<p>On receiving this information Tish stood for a
moment in deep thought. She then instructed
Aggie to go on to the balloon hangar and open the
doors, while she and I gathered up her personal
possessions and followed.</p>

<p>It is not our method to question Tish at such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
times; ours not to reason why, ours but to do and
die. But I confess to a certain uneasiness. If she
proposed to escape by means of the baby blimp,
well and good. At the same time, it required a
dozen men to haul the balloon out of its shed, and
we were but three weak women. I believed that
she had overlooked this, but, as usual, I underestimated
her.</p>

<p>On reaching the hangar I found the door open,
and I could see in the darkness the large balloon,
with what appeared to be a smaller one beside it,
a matter of surprise to me, as I knew of no other.
But I could not see Aggie.</p>

<p>I entered as quietly as possible and advanced
into the hangar.</p>

<p>“Aggie!” I called in a low tone. “Aggie!
Where are you?”</p>

<p>There was a silence, then from somewhere
above came a sneeze, followed by Aggie’s voice,
broken and trembling.</p>

<p>“On—on a r-r-rafter, Lizzie,” she said.</p>

<p>I could not believe my ears and advanced
towards the sound. Suddenly Aggie yelled, and
at the same moment the smaller balloon lurched
and came toward me.</p>

<p>“Run!” Aggie yelled. “Run. She’s after you!”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the warning came too late.
Something reached out from the running balloon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
and caught me around the body, and the next
moment, to my horror, I was lifted off the ground
and thrust up into the timbers which supported
the roof of the building. I am a heavy woman,
and only by a desperate effort did I catch a rafter
as the thing let go of me, and drew myself to
safety. Aggie was somewhere close at hand, sobbing
in the darkness.</p>

<p>It was a moment before I could speak. Then
I managed to ask what had happened to me.</p>

<p>“It’s Katie, Lizzie,” Aggie said between sobs.
“I think she must have found the blackberry
cordial we left here, and it’s gone to her head!”</p>

<p>Our position was very unfortunate, especially
as time was important. Katie was merely playful,
but on any attempt to move on our part she would
trumpet loudly and reach up for us. Most annoying
of all, she had taken a fancy to one of my shoes
and kept reaching up and pulling at it.</p>

<p>“Let her have it, if it keeps her quiet,” Aggie
said tartly when I told her. “Give her anything
she wants. Give her your bonnet. I never liked
it, anyhow.”</p>

<p>It was then after midnight, but fortunately it
was very soon after that that we saw an electric
flash and heard our dear Tish’s voice.</p>

<p>“Aggie! Lizzie!” she called. And then she
saw the elephant and advanced toward her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“Katie!” she said. “What are you doing here?
I’ve been looking for you all over the lot!” She
then turned the flash on Katie and beheld her
swaying. “Shame on you,” she said. “I believe
you’ve been drinking.”</p>

<p>“Don’t reprove her; kill her”; Aggie said suddenly
from overhead, and Tish looked up.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” she said rather sharply. “I cannot
count on the faintest coöperation. I need two
courageous hearts, and I find you roosting like
frightened chickens on a beam. That elephant’s
harmless. She’s only playing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the way she plays, then,” I
protested angrily. “If you do, play with her yourself.”</p>

<p>But Tish had no time for irony. She simply
picked up a piece of wood from the ground and hit
Katie on the trunk with it.</p>

<p>“Now!” she said. “Bring them down, you
shame to your sex. And be gentle. Remember
you are not quite yourself.”</p>

<p>Thanks to Tish’s dominance over all types of
inferior minds, Katie at once obeyed, and brought
us down without difficulty.</p>

<p>Then she ambled unsteadily to a corner, and
proceeded to empty another bottle of cordial we
had concealed there.</p>

<p>I have always considered, in spite of its dénouement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
that Tish’s idea of using Katie to drag the
blimp out of the shed was a brilliant one. Katie
herself made no demur. She stood swaying gently
while we harnessed her to the balloon and at the
word she bent to her work. Tish was in the car,
examining the controls at the time, and turning
up what I believe are called the flippers, which
direct its course away from Mother Earth.</p>

<p>But I have blamed her for her impatience in
starting the engine before we had unfastened
Katie’s harness. Tish has a tendency now and
then toward hasty action, which she always regrets
later. There is this excuse for her, however:
She had apparently no idea that the balloon
would rise the moment the propeller reached a
certain number of revolutions. But it did.</p>

<p>It seemed only a moment after we heard the
engine start that I felt the car lifting from the
earth, and in desperation flung myself into it, as
Aggie did the same thing from the other side.</p>

<p>The next instant we were well above the ground,
and from below there was coming a terrible
trumpeting and squealing. We all looked over
the side, and there beneath us was Katie, fastened
to us by her harness and rising with us!</p>

<p>I shall never forget that moment. One and all,
we are members of the Humane Society. And if
Katie’s ropes and straps gave way, she would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
certainly fall to a terrible death. Even Tish lost
her sang-froid and, frantically starting the
engine, endeavored to maneuver the thing to earth
again. But anybody who has traveled in a blimp
knows that it cannot be brought to earth again
without outside aid.</p>

<p>Moreover, we were already outside the studio
grounds, and traveling over roofs which Katie
barely escaped. Indeed, from certain sounds, we
had reason to believe that she was striking numerous
chimneys, and I think now that this may
account for the stories of a mysterious electric
storm that night, which destroyed a half dozen
chimneys in one block.</p>

<p>It was a fortunate thing that Tish remembered
in time to elevate the flippers still further, thus
giving us a certain amount of leeway. But a
strong breeze from the sea had sprung up and was
carrying us toward the city, and it became increasingly
evident that, even if we cleared the highest
buildings, Katie would not.</p>

<p>It was a tragic moment. Aggie proposed lightening
the craft by throwing out the bottles of
liquor, which had been a part of the smugglers’
cargo in the picture, but Tish restrained her.</p>

<p>“Better to kill an elephant,” she said, “than to
brain some harmless wretch below.”</p>

<p>Katie meanwhile had lapsed into the silence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
despair, or possibly had fainted. I do not know,
nor is it now pertinent, for in a few moments the
situation solved itself. We had barely missed the
roof of the First National Bank Building when the
blimp gave a terrific jar, and momentarily stopped.</p>

<p>On looking over the side the cause of this was
explained. Katie had landed squarely on the flat
roof of the building, and had immediately thrown
her trunk around a chimney and braced herself.
Even as we looked, her harness parted and left her
free of us.</p>

<p>Katie was saved.</p>

<p>Glancing again over the side as we quickly rose,
we could see her in the moonlight still hugging her
chimney and gazing after us. What thoughts
were hers we cannot know.</p>

<p>I am glad to solve in this manner a problem
which caused much perplexity throughout the
country—namely, how an elephant could have
reached the roof of the First National Bank
Building, to which the only possible entrance was
through a trapdoor two feet six inches each way.
As will be seen, the explanation, like that of many
mysteries, is entirely simple.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is necessary to touch but lightly on the unfortunate
incident which concluded our escape.
That the apparently friendly villagers who, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
next morning, ran out from their peaceful businesses
to haul on our ropes and bring us to a landing,
should so change in attitude in a few moments
has ever since been a warning to us of the innate
suspicion of human nature.</p>

<p>How could they look at Tish’s firm and noble
face, and so misread it? Why did they not at
once open the smugglers’ rum cargo which had
remained in the car, and discover that the liquid
in the bottles was only cold tea?</p>

<p>Can it be possible that Charlie Sands’ explanation
is correct, and that the fact that many of
them purchased the stuff from the sheriff and
later threatened to lynch him, can account for his
peculiar malignity to us?</p>

<p>One thing is certain—they held us in the local
jail for days, until Charlie Sands was able to
rescue us.</p>

<p>We never saw Mr. Stein again. Nor, frankly,
did we ever expect to see Tish’s picture, since she
had not finished it. But, as all the world now
knows, it opened in June of this current year, and
made a great success.</p>

<p>But our surprise at this was as nothing compared
with the fact that Tish’s name did not appear
in connection with it, and that the announcements
read: “Featuring Miss Betty Carlisle.”</p>

<p>There had been no Miss Carlisle in Tish’s cast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>On the opening night we went to see it, accompanied
by Charlie Sands. He said very little
while watching Tish perform her various exploits,
but when, after the shooting scene, Tish prepared
to depart he protested.</p>

<p>“I’ve stood it up to this point,” he said grimly.
“I propose to see it through.”</p>

<p>“There will be no more, Charles,” Tish explained
in an indulgent manner. “I quit at the
end of this scene. Be glad of one picture which
does not end with an embrace.”</p>

<p>But she had spoken too soon!</p>

<p>Judge of our amazement when we saw our Tish,
on the screen, disappear through a doorway, and
return a moment later, a young and beautiful girl,
who was at once clasped in Mr. Macmanus’ arms.</p>

<p>The title was: Her Elderly Disguise at Last
Removed!</p>

</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>It was last May that Tish’s cousin, Annabelle
Carter, wrote to her and asked her to take Lily
May for the summer.</p>

<p>“I need a rest, Tish,” she wrote. “I need a rest
from her. I want to go off where I can eat a cup
custard without her looking at my waistline, and
can smoke an occasional cigarette without having
to steal one of hers when she is out. I may even
bob my hair.”</p>

<p>“She’ll smoke no cigarettes here,” Tish interjected.
“And Annabelle Carter’s a fool. Always
was and always will be. Bob her hair indeed!”</p>

<p>She read on: “I want you to take her, Tish,
and show her that high principles still exist in
the older generation. They seem to think we are
all hypocrites and whited sepulchers. But most
of all, I want to get her away from Billy Field.
He is an enchanting person, but he couldn’t buy
gas for her car. Jim says if he can earn a thousand
dollars this summer he’ll think about it. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
outside of bootlegging, how can he? And he has
promised not to do that.”</p>

<p>Tish had read us the letter, but she had already
made up her mind.</p>

<p>“It is a duty,” she said, “and I have never
shirked a duty. Annabelle Carter has no more
right to have a daughter than I have; I’ve seen
her playing bridge and poker before that child.
And she serves liquor in her house, although it
is against the law of the nation.”</p>

<p>And later on: “What the girl needs,” she said,
“is to be taken away from the artificial life she is
living, and to meet with Nature. Nature,” she
said, “is always natural. A mountain is always
a mountain; the sea is the sea. Sufficient of either
should make her forget that boy.”</p>

<p>“Too much of either might, Tish,” I said, rather
tartly. “You can drown her or throw her over
a precipice, of course. But if you think she’ll
trade him for a view or a sailboat, you’d better
think again.”</p>

<p>But Tish was not listening.</p>

<p>“An island,” she said, “would be ideal. Just the
four of us, and Hannah. Simple living and high
thinking. That’s what the young girls of to-day
require.”</p>

<p>“I often wonder,” Aggie said sadly, “what Mr.
Wiggins would have thought of them! I remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
how shocked he was when his Cousin Harriet
used ice on her face before a party, to make her
cheeks pink.”</p>

<p>So the matter was determined, and Tish appealed
to Charlie Sands, her nephew, to find her
an island. I shall never forget his face when she
told him why.</p>

<p>“A flapper!” he said. “Well, your work’s cut
out for you all right.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Tish said sharply. “I have been
a girl myself. I understand girls.”</p>

<p>“Have you made any preparations for her?”</p>

<p>“I’ve bought a set of Louisa M. Alcott. And I
can hire a piano if she wants to keep in practice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’ll keep in practice all right,” he said,
“but I wouldn’t bother with a piano.” He did
not explain this, but went away soon after. “I’ll
do my best to find you an island,” he said cryptically,
as he departed, “but the chances are she can
swim.”</p>

<p>That last sentence of his made Tish thoughtful,
and she determined that, if our summer was to
be spent on the sea, we should all learn to swim.
I cannot say that the result was successful. Indeed,
our very first lesson almost ended in a
tragedy, for it was Tish’s theory that one must
start in deep water.</p>

<p>“The natural buoyancy of the water is greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
there,” she said. “One goes in and then simply
strikes out.”</p>

<p>She did this, therefore, standing on the diving
board in the correct position—the instructor was
not yet ready—and made a very nice dive. But
she did not come up again, although the water was
very agitated, and after a time Aggie became
alarmed and called the instructor. He found her
at last, but she was so filled with water that we
abandoned the lesson for the day.</p>

<p>As the instructor said to her, “All you need is
a few goldfish, lady, and you’d be a first-class
aquarium.”</p>

<p>And then, with all our ideas of setting Lily May
an example of dignity and decorum, along about
the middle of June Hannah, going out on a Thursday,
came creeping in about nine o’clock at night
and brought in the tray with cake and blackberry
cordial, with her hat on.</p>

<p>“What do you mean,” Tish demanded, fixing
her with a stony glare, “by coming in here like
that?”</p>

<p>Hannah set the tray down and looked rather
pale.</p>

<p>“It’s my hat, Miss Tish,” she said; “and it’s
my head.”</p>

<p>“Take it off,” said Tish. “Your hat, not your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
head. Not that you’d miss one more than the
other.”</p>

<p>So Hannah took her hat off, and she had had
her hair shingle-bobbed! I never saw anything
more dreadful, unless it was our dear Tish’s face.
She looked at her for some moments in silence.</p>

<p>“Have you seen yourself?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall add no further punishment,” said
Tish grimly. “But as I do not propose to look at
you in this condition, you will continue to wear a
hat until it grows out again.”</p>

<p>“I’m to wear a hat over the stove?”</p>

<p>“You’re to wear a hat over yourself, Hannah,”
Tish corrected her, and Hannah went out in tears.</p>

<p>It was very strange, after that, to see Hannah
serving the table with a hat on, but our dear Tish
is firmness itself when it comes to a matter of
principle, and even the discovery of an artificial
rosebud in the stewed lamb one day did not cause
her to weaken. I shall, however, never forget
Lily May’s expression when Hannah served
luncheon the day she arrived.</p>

<p>She came in, followed by a taxi man and the
janitor of Tish’s apartment building, who were
loaded down with bags and hat boxes, and having
kissed Tish without any particular warmth, turned
to the janitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“Go easy with that bag, Charles,” she said. His
name is not Charles, but this seemed not to worry
her. “If you break the contents Miss Carberry
will be out her summer liquor.”</p>

<p>As Tish has been for many years a member of
the W.C.T.U., she protested at once, but the taxi
man seemed to think it funny until Tish turned
on him.</p>

<p>“It is you,” she said, “and your kind who make
it impossible to enforce the best law our nation
has ever passed. If there is liquor in that bag,”
she said to Lily May, “it will not remain in this
apartment one instant. Lizzie, open the bag, and
pour the wretched stuff into the kitchen sink.”</p>

<p>I was about to open the bag, when the taxi
man said that, while he was not a drinking man,
plenty of hospitals need stimulants.</p>

<p>“You pour it down the sink,” he said, “and
where is it? Nowhere, lady. But if I take it to
the Samaritan, and they use it—why, it’s a
Christian action, as I see it.”</p>

<p>I will say for Lily May that she offered no
objection. She stood by, looking at each of us
in turn and seeming rather puzzled. She only
spoke once.</p>

<p>“Look here, Aunt Tish,” she began, “I was
only——”</p>

<p>“I shall discuss this with you later and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
private,” Tish cut in sternly, and motioned me to
open the bag.</p>

<p>I did so, but it contained no alcoholic stimulant
whatever; only a number of bottles and jars for
the toilet. Tish eyed them, and then turned to
Lily May.</p>

<p>“Have I your word of honor,” she said, “that
these are what they purport to be?”</p>

<p>“Probably not,” said Lily May coolly. “Nothing
is these days. But there’s nothing there
for Volstead to beat his breast about. I tried
to tell you.”</p>

<p>While she was in her room taking off her things,
Tish expressed herself with her usual clearness on
the situation in which she found herself.</p>

<p>“Already,” she said, “the girl has shown two
of the most undesirable modern qualities—flippancy
and a disregard for the law of the nation.
I am convinced that I saw a box of rouge in that
bag, Lizzie.”</p>

<p>But when, later on, she accused Lily May of
making up her face, Lily May only smiled sweetly
and said she was obliged to do so.</p>

<p>“Obliged!” Tish sniffed. “Don’t talk nonsense.”</p>

<p>“Not nonsense at all,” said Lily May. “All
the——” She seemed to hesitate. “It’s like this,”
she said. “Make-up is respectable. The other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
thing isn’t. When you see a woman these days
with a dead-white face, watch her. That’s all.”</p>

<p>Poor Aggie cast an agonized glance at herself
in the mirror, but Tish stared hard at Lily May.</p>

<p>“There are certain subjects on which I do not
wish to be informed,” she said coldly.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” said Lily May. “If you like
to think that the Easter bunny lays hardboiled
eggs——”</p>

<p>I must say things looked very uncomfortable
from the start. Nobody could accuse Lily May
of being any trouble, or even of being unpleasant;
she had a very sweet smile, and she did everything
she was told. But she seemed to regard the
three of us as mere children, and this was particularly
galling to Tish.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t we see that picture?” Tish
demanded one night, when she steered us away
from a movie we had been waiting three weeks
to see.</p>

<p>“It’s not a nice movie,” said Lily May gently,
and took us to see The Ten Commandments,
which we had already seen three times.</p>

<p>It was a difficult situation, for of course Tish
could not insist on going, after that. And Aggie
suffered also, for on the hay-fever season coming
on she brought out her medicinal cigarettes, and
Lily May walked right out and bought her a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
vaporizing lamp instead, which smelled simply
horrible when lighted.</p>

<p>But it was over Hannah that Tish suffered the
most, for of course Lily May had had her hair
bobbed, and Hannah rebelled the first minute she
saw it.</p>

<p>“Either she wears a hat or I don’t, Miss Tish,”
she said. “And you’d better put a hat on her.
The way that janitor is hanging around this place
is simply sinful.”</p>

<p>It ended by Hannah abandoning her hat, copying
Lily May’s method of fixing her hair; only
where Lily May’s hair hung straight and dark,
Hannah was obliged to use soap to gain the same
effect.</p>

<p>As Tish observed to her scathingly, “It will
break off some night in your sleep. And then
where will you be?”</p>

<p>It became evident before long that the city
simply would not do for Lily May. The grocer’s
boy took to forgetting things so he could make a
second trip, and in the market one day Mr.
Jurgens, Tish’s butcher, handed Lily May a bunch
of pansies.</p>

<p>“Pansies are for thoughts, Miss Lily May,” he
said.</p>

<p>And Tish said he looked so like a sick calf that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
she absently ordered veal for dinner, although
she had meant to have lamb chops.</p>

<p>Other things, too, began to worry us. One was
that although Lily May had, according to orders,
received no letters from the Field youth, Hannah’s
mail had suddenly increased. For years she had
received scarcely anything but the catalogue of a
mail-order house, and now there was seldom a
mail went by without her getting something.</p>

<p>Another was Tish’s discovery that Lily May
wore hardly any clothes. I shall never forget the
day Tish discovered how little she actually wore.
It was wash day, and Tish had engaged Mrs.
Schwartz for an extra day.</p>

<p>“There will be extra petticoats and—er—undergarments,
Mrs. Schwartz,” she explained.
“I well remember in my young days that my dear
mother always alluded to the expense of my
frillies.”</p>

<p>It has been Tish’s theory for years that no
decent woman ever appears without a flannel
petticoat under her muslin one, and I shall never
forget the severe lecture she read Aggie when,
one warm summer day, she laid hers aside. It
was therefore a serious shock to her to come
home the next day and find Mrs. Schwartz scrubbing
the kitchen floor, while Hannah was drinking
a cup of tea and gossiping with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“The young lady’s clothes!” said Mrs. Schwartz.
“Why, bless your heart, I pressed them off in
fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>It turned out that Lily May wore only a single
garment beneath her frock. I cannot express in
words Tish’s shock at this discovery, or her complete
discouragement when, having brought out
her best white flannel petticoat and a muslin one
with blind embroidery, of which she is very fond,
Lily May flatly refused to put them on.</p>

<p>“Why?” she said. “I’m not going to pretend
I haven’t got legs. My feet have to be fastened
to something.”</p>

<p>It was in this emergency that Tish sent for
Charlie Sands, but I regret to say that he was of
very little assistance to us. Lily May was demure
and quiet at first, and sat playing with something
in her hand. Finally she dropped it, and it was
a small white cube with spots on each side.
Charlie Sands picked it up and looked at Lily
May.</p>

<p>“Got the other?” he asked.</p>

<p>Well, she had, and it seems one plays a sort
of game with them, for in a very short time they
were both sitting on the floor, and she won, I
think, a dollar and thirty cents.</p>

<p>I cannot recall this situation without a pang,
for our dear Tish never gambles, and is averse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
to all games of chance. Indeed, she went so pale
that Aggie hastily brought her a glass of blackberry
cordial, and even this was unfortunate, for
Lily May looked up and said, “If you want
mother’s recipe for homemade gin I think I can
remember it.”</p>

<p>Tish was utterly disheartened when Charlie
Sands went away, but he seemed to think everything
would be all right.</p>

<p>“She’s a nice child,” he said. “She’s only living
up to a type. And there isn’t an ounce of hypocrisy
in her. I can see through her, all right.”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” Tish retorted grimly. “So can
anyone else, when the sun is shining.”</p>

<p>But the climax really came when old Mr.
Barnes, on the floor above Tish’s apartment, sent
her a note. It seems that he had asthma and sat
at the window just above Lily May’s, and the note
he sent was to ask Tish not to smoke cigarettes
out her window. I really thought Tish
would have a stroke on the head of it, and if
Annabelle Carter hadn’t been in Europe I am
quite sure she would have sent Lily May back
home.</p>

<p>But there we were, with Lily May on our hands
for three months, and Hannah already rolling
her stockings below her knees and with one eyebrow
almost gone, where she had tried to shave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
it to a line with a razor. And then one day Aggie
began to talk about long hair being a worry, and
that it would be easier to put on her tonic if it
was short; and with that Tish took the island
Charlie Sands had found, and we started.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>I shall never forget Lily May’s expression when
she saw Tish trying on the knickerbockers which
are her usual wear when in the open.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t!” she said in a sort of wail.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Tish demanded tartly. “At least
they cover me, which is more than I can say of
some of your clothes.”</p>

<p>“But they’re not—not feminine,” said Lily
May, and Tish stared at her.</p>

<p>“Feminine!” she said. “The outdoors is not
a matter of sex. Thank God, the sea is sexless;
so are the rocks and trees.”</p>

<p>“But the people——”</p>

<p>“There will be no people,” said Tish with an air
of finality.</p>

<p>The next few days were busy ones. Tish had
immediately, on learning that the New England
coast has several varieties of fish, decided that we
could combine change and isolation with fishing
for the market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>“Save for the cost of the bait,” she said,
“which should be immaterial, there is no expense
involved. The sea is still free, although the bootleggers
seem to think they own it. But I do not
intend to profit by this freedom. The money thus
earned will go to foreign missions.”</p>

<p>She bought a book on New England fish, and
spent a long time studying it. Then she went
to our local fish market and secured a list of
prices.</p>

<p>“With any luck,” she said, “we should catch
a hundred pounds or so a day. At sixty cents a
pound, that’s sixty dollars, or we’ll say thirty-six
hundred dollars for the summer. There may be
a bad day now and then.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ostermaier, our clergyman, was greatly
impressed, and felt that the money should perhaps
go toward a new organ. Tish, however,
held out for missions, and in the end
they compromised on a kitchen for the parish
house.</p>

<p>Toward the end, Lily May began to take more
interest in our preparations. At first she had
been almost indifferent, observing that any old
place would do, and the sooner the better.</p>

<p>“It will give you something to do,” Tish told
her severely.</p>

<p>“So would a case of hives,” she replied, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
lapsed again into the lethargy which Tish found
so trying.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, she cheered up greatly before
our departure, and we all felt much encouraged.
She never spoke to us of Billy Field,
but she had made Hannah a confidante, and
Hannah told Aggie that it was apparently off.</p>

<p>“It’s this way, Miss Aggie,” she said. “He’s
got to earn a thousand dollars this summer, one
way or another, and I guess he’s about as likely
to do it as you are to catch a whale.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was significant, although I did not
think of it at the time, that Aggie did catch a
whale later on; and that indeed our troubles began
with that unlucky incident.</p>

<p>But Lily May became really quite cheery as the
time for departure approached, and we began to
grow very much attached to her, although she
inadvertently got us into a certain amount of
trouble on the train going up.</p>

<p>She had brought along a pack of cards, and
taught us a game called cold hands, a curious
name, but a most interesting idea. One is dealt
five cards, and puts a match in the center of the
table. Then one holds up various combinations,
such as pairs, three of a kind, and so on, and
draws again. Whoever has the best hand at the
end takes all the matches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>Tish, I remember, had all the matches in front
of her, and rang for the porter to bring a fresh
box. But when he came back the conductor came
along and said gambling was not allowed.</p>

<p>“Gambling!” Tish said. “Gambling! Do you
suppose I would gamble on this miserable railroad
of yours, when at any moment I may have
to meet my Creator?”</p>

<p>“If it isn’t gambling, what is it?”</p>

<p>And then Lily May looked up at him sweetly
and said, “Now run away and don’t tease, or
mamma spank.”</p>

<p>That is exactly what she said. And instead of
reproving her that wretched conductor only
grinned at her and went away. What, as Tish
says, can one do with a generation which threatens
an older and wiser one with corporal punishment?</p>

<p>We had telegraphed ahead for a motor boat to
meet us and take us over to Paris Island, and we
found it waiting; quite a handsome boat named
the Swallow, a name which Tish later observed
evidently did not refer to the bird of that sort,
but to other qualities it possessed.</p>

<p>“Swallow!” she snorted. “It’s well named.
The thing tried to swallow the whole Atlantic
Ocean.”</p>

<p>It was in charge of a young fisherman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
named Christopher Columbus Jefferson Spudd.</p>

<p>“It sounds rather like a coal bucket falling down
the cellar stairs,” said Lily May, giving him a
cold glance.</p>

<p>And indeed he looked very queer. He had
a nice face and a good figure, but his clothes were
simply horrible. He wore a checked suit with a
short coat, very tight at the waist, and pockets
with buttons on everywhere. And he had a baby-blue
necktie and a straw hat with a fancy ribbon
on it, and too small for his head.</p>

<p>Lily May put her hand up as if he dazzled her,
and said, “What do we call you if we want you?
If we ever do,” she added unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“Just call me anything you like, miss,” he said
with a long look at her, “and I’ll come running.
I kind of like Christopher myself.”</p>

<p>“You would!” said Lily May, and turned her
back on him.</p>

<p>But, as Tish said that night, we might as well
employ him as anyone else.</p>

<p>“Do what we will,” she said, “we might as well
recognize the fact that the presence of Lily May
is to the other sex what catnip is to a cat. It
simply sets them rolling. And,” she added, “if
it must be somebody, better Christopher, who is
young and presumably unattached, than an older
man with a wife and children. Besides, his boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
is a fast one, and we shall lose no time getting to
and from the fishing grounds.”</p>

<p>We therefore decided to retain Christopher and
the Swallow, although the price, two hundred and
fifty dollars a month, seemed rather high.</p>

<p>“We do not need Christopher,” she said, “but
if we must take him with the boat we must. He
can chop wood and so on.”</p>

<p>We spent the next day getting settled. The
island was a small one, with only a few fishermen’s
houses on it, and Tish drew a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“No man except Christopher,” she said to me.
“And she detests him. And who can be small
in the presence of the Atlantic Ocean? She will
go back a different girl, Lizzie. Already she is
less selfish. I heard her tell Hannah to-night,
referring to Christopher, to ‘feed the brute well.’
There was true thoughtfulness behind that.”</p>

<p>Christopher, of course, ate in the kitchen.</p>

<p>It was the next morning that Tish called him
in from the woodpile and asked him about the
size of codfish.</p>

<p>“Codfish?” he said. “Well, now, I reckon
they’d run a pound or so.”</p>

<p>“A pound or so?” Tish demanded indignantly.
“There is one in the natural history
museum at home that must weigh sixty pounds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, well,” he said, “if you’re talking about
museum pieces, there are whales around here that
weigh pretty considerable. But you take the run
of cod, the oil variety, and you get ’em all sizes.
Depends on their age,” he added.</p>

<p>Tish says that she knew then that he was no
fisherman, but it was not for several days that
he told her his story.</p>

<p>“I am not exactly a fisherman,” he said. “I
can run a boat all right, so you needn’t worry,
but in the winter I clerk in a shoe store in Bangor,
Maine. But there is no career in the shoe business,
especially on a commission basis. In New
England the real money goes to the half-sole-and-heel
people.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s so,” said Tish. “I never
thought of it.”</p>

<p>“Then,” he went on, “you take automobiles.
Did you ever think how they’ve hurt the sale of
shoes? Nobody walks. Folks that used to buy
a pair of shoes every year have dropped clean
off my list. The tailors are getting my business.”</p>

<p>“Tailors?” Tish asked.</p>

<p>“Putting new seats in trousers,” he said
gloomily, and stalked away.</p>

<p>The boat, he told us later, belonged to his uncle,
who was a tailor. But he was not tailoring at
present. As a matter of fact, he was at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
moment in the state penitentiary, and that was
how Christopher had the Swallow.</p>

<p>“He took to bootlegging on the side,” he explained.</p>

<p>“It was a sort of natural evolution, as you may
say. He noticed the wear and tear on hip pockets
from carrying flasks, and it seized on his imagination.”
He mopped discouragedly at the boat, in
which we were about to go on our first fishing
trip, and sighed. “Many a case of good hard
liquor has run the revenue blockade in this,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Well, there will be no liquor run in it while
I’m renting it,” said Tish firmly.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>I cannot say that the fishing was what we had
expected. There was plenty of fish, and Tish
grew quite expert at opening clams and putting
them on her hook. But as Aggie could never
bear the smell of clams at any time, and as the
rocking of the boat seriously disturbed her, we
had rather a troublesome time with her. Once
she even begged to be thrown overboard.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Tish said. “You can’t swim and
you know it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to swim, Tish,” she said pitifully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
“I just want to die, and the quicker the better.”</p>

<p>On rough days, too, when an occasional wave
dashed over us, and Tish would shake herself and
speak of the bracing effect of salt water, our poor
Aggie would fall into violent sneezing, and more
than once lost a fish by so doing. And I shall
never forget the day when she drew up a squid,
and the wretched thing squirted its ink all over
her. There was a certain dignity in the way she
turned her blackened face to Tish.</p>

<p>“I have stood for clams, Tish,” she said, “and
I have stood for the rocking of this d-damned
boat. But when the very creatures of the deep
insult me I’m through!”</p>

<p>As, however, a wave came overboard just then
and removed practically all the ink, as well as
the squid itself, she was fortunately unable to express
herself further. It speaks well for our
dear Tish’s self-control that she allowed Aggie’s
speech to pass without reproof, and even offered
her a small glass of blackberry cordial from the
bottle we always carried with us.</p>

<p>But it was in the matter of payment for the
fish that our plans suffered a serious reverse.
We had on our first day out taken what we imagined
was a hundred pounds of various sorts,
many unknown to us, and on the way to the fish
wharf, while Aggie and I neatly arranged them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
as to sizes, Tish figured out the probable value.</p>

<p>“About forty dollars,” she said. “And if they
take that thing with whiskers under its chin, even
more. Gasoline, one dollar. Christopher’s wages
and boat hire per day, eight dollars. Clams, a
dollar and a quarter. Leaving a net profit of
twenty-nine dollars and seventy-five cents, or clear
every month eight hundred and seventy dollars
and fifty cents.”</p>

<p>She closed her notebook and we drew in under
the fish wharf, where a man who was chewing
tobacco came to the edge and looked down at us.</p>

<p>“We are selling these fish,” Tish said with her
usual dignity. “They are quite fresh, and ought
to bring the best market rates.”</p>

<p>The man spit into the water and then glanced
at our boxes.</p>

<p>“Jerry!” he called. “Want any more fish?”</p>

<p>“What kind of fish?” a voice replied from back
in the shed.</p>

<p>The man squinted again at our catch.</p>

<p>“Looks like succotash to me,” he called.</p>

<p>Jerry came out and stared down at us, and then
slowly descended the ladder to the boat. He had
a mean face, Tish says, and he made us about as
welcome as the bubonic plague. He said nothing,
but picked out six haddock and handed them
up to the man above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“Thirty cents,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m paying sixty in the market,” Tish protested.</p>

<p>“Thirty-five,” he repeated, and started up the
ladder.</p>

<p>“Forty,” said Tish firmly.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said with bitterness, “all
you’ve had to do is to catch those fish. That’s
easy; the sea’s full of ’em. What have I got to
do? I’ve got to clean ’em and pack ’em and ice
’em and ship ’em. I’m overpaying you; that’s
what I’m doing.”</p>

<p>“What am I going to do with the others?” Tish
demanded angrily. “Seventy pounds of good fish,
and half the nation needing food.”</p>

<p>“You might send it to Congress,” he suggested.
“They say it’s good for the brain—phosphorus.”</p>

<p>“You must eat a great deal of fish!” said Tish
witheringly.</p>

<p>“Or,” he said, brightening, “take it home to the
cat. There’s nothing a cat will get real worked
up about like a nice mess of fish.”</p>

<p>He then went up the ladder, leaving us in
speechless fury. But Tish recovered quickly and
began figuring again. “Six haddock at seven
pounds each,” she said. “Forty-two pounds at
thirty-five cents per pound, or about fourteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
dollars. At least we’ve made our expenses. And
of course we can eat some.”</p>

<p>Aggie, who had felt the motion severely coming
in, raised herself from the bottom of the boat at
this, and asked for another sip of cordial.</p>

<p>“They smell,” she wailed, and fell back again.</p>

<p>“All perfectly healthy fish smell,” said Tish.</p>

<p>“So does a healthy skunk,” said Aggie, holding
her handkerchief to her nose, “but I don’t pretend
to like it.”</p>

<p>And then Jerry came down the ladder and
handed Tish a quarter and a five-cent piece!</p>

<p>“There you are,” he said cheerfully. “One of
them’s a bit wormy, but we say here that a
wormy fish is a healthy fish.”</p>

<p>I draw a veil over the painful scene that followed.
That fish house paid two-thirds of a cent
a pound for fish, no more and no less, and the
more Tish raged the higher Jerry retreated up the
ladder until he was on the wharf again. From
there he looked down at us before he disappeared.</p>

<p>“You might get more out in the desert, lady,”
he said as a parting shot. “But then, you’d get
a pretty good price for a plate of ice cream
in hell too.”</p>

<p>And with that he disappeared, and left us to
face our situation.</p>

<p>Our deficit on the day, according to Tish, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
ten dollars. In three months it would amount to
nine hundred dollars. She closed her notebook
with a snap.</p>

<p>“Unless we count intangible assets,” she said,
“we shall certainly be bankrupt. Of course there
is the gain in health; the salt air——”</p>

<p>“Health!” said Aggie feebly. “A little more
of this, Tish Carberry, and Jerry will be cleaning
and packing and icing and shipping something
that isn’t fish.”</p>

<p>“Then again,” said Tish, ignoring this outburst,
“we may find something unusual. There
are whales about here, according to Christopher.
And the oil of the whale is still used, I believe.”</p>

<p>But after learning from Christopher that
whales ranged in size from fifty to one hundred
feet, and were not caught on a line, however
heavy, but with a knife thrown into some vital
part, she was compelled to abandon this idea. Indeed,
I do not know how we should have filled up
our summer had it not been that on that very
evening we received a visit from a Mr. MacDonald,
who turned out to be the deputy sheriff
on the island.</p>

<p>Aggie was still far from well that night. She
said the floor kept rising and falling, and at
dinner several times she had clutched at her
plate to keep it from sliding off the table. So she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
had been about to pour herself a glass of blackberry
cordial, when Lily May saw Mr. MacDonald
coming, and hastily took the bottle and
hid it under a table.</p>

<p>Christopher brought him in, and he sat down
and began to sniff almost immediately. But he
said that he had called to secure our assistance;
it wasn’t often he needed help, but he needed it
now.</p>

<p>“It’s these here rum runners, ladies,” he said.
“You take a place like this, all islands and about
a million of them. We’ve got as much coast line
as the state of California.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” said Tish politely.</p>

<p>“And they know every inch of it. And every
trick,” he added. “’Tain’t more than a week now
since the government inspector found a case of
Black and White tied under the surface to one of
the channel buoys. And who’s to know whether
the fellows hauling up lobster pots aren’t hauling
up something else too?”</p>

<p>“Very probably they are,” said Tish dryly—“from
the price of lobsters.”</p>

<p>“There’s liquor all around these waters. Last
big storm we had, a lot of it must have got
smashed up, and there was a porpoise reeling
around the town wharf for two or three hours.
Finally it brought up against one of the poles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
of the fish pier and went asleep there. It was a
disgraceful exhibition.”</p>

<p>“Tish,” Aggie said suddenly, “if this floor
doesn’t keep still that bottle will upset.”</p>

<p>Mr. MacDonald stared at her and then cleared
his throat.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m taking for granted,” he said,
“that you ladies believe in upholding the law.”</p>

<p>“We are members of the W.C.T.U.,” Tish
explained. “We stand ready to assist our nation
in every possible way. We do not even believe
in beer and light wines.”</p>

<p>He seemed reassured at that, and explained
what he wanted. The Government had a number
of patrol boats outside, and they were doing their
best, but in spite of them liquor was coming in
and was being shipped hither and yon.</p>

<p>“The worst of it is,” he said, “we don’t know
who we can trust. Only last week I paid a fellow
fifteen dollars good money to take me out and
locate a rum runner, and he got lost in the fog
and had to come back. Yesterday I learned he
got forty dollars from the other side for getting
lost.”</p>

<p>His idea was that under pretense of fishing we
could assist him by watching for the criminals,
and reporting anything we saw that was suspicious.
As Tish said afterward, there was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
profit for the church in the arrangement, but there
was a spiritual gain to all of us.</p>

<p>“There are things one cannot measure in dollars
and cents,” she said.</p>

<p>We all agreed, and rose to see Mr. MacDonald
to the door. But I think he left in a divided state
of mind, for Christopher, standing near the table,
upset the bottle of blackberry cordial, and Aggie,
who had been watching it, gave a wail and started
for it. But the floor was still going up and down
to her, and her progress across the room was most
unsteady.</p>

<p>It is to this unfortunate combination undoubtedly
that we owe our later ill luck. For Mr.
MacDonald caught her as she was about to bump
the mantel, and still holding her, turned to Tish.</p>

<p>“That fellow that double-crossed me,” he said
with meaning, “he got thirty days.”</p>

<p>“When we agree to do a thing we do it,” Tish
said stiffly.</p>

<p>“So did he,” said Mr. MacDonald, and went
away, taking a final sniff at the door.</p>

<p>Tish made her usual preparations for our new
rôle. She at once sent to Bar Harbor for a pair
of field glasses, and oiled and loaded her revolver.</p>

<p>“Not that I mean to shoot them,” she said,
“but a well-placed shot or two can wreck their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
engine. In that case all we shall have to do is to
tow them in.”</p>

<p>She procured also a good towing rope for this
purpose, and spent her odd time the next day or
two shooting at a floating target in the water.
Unfortunately, the fact that a bullet will travel
over the water like a skipping stone escaped her,
and our next-door neighbor, who was just hauling
in the largest halibut of the season, had the
misfortune to have his line cut in half and of
seeing the halibut escape.</p>

<p>On the other hand, her resolution was strengthened
by a letter from Charlie Sands, her nephew,
which showed the moral deterioration being
fostered by these wretched liquor smugglers.</p>

<p>“Dear Aunt Tish,” he wrote. “It has just
occurred to me that you are near the Canadian
border. Scotch ought to be good and also cheap
there. Why not fill a hot-water bag or two for
me? Even a bottle or two would not come amiss,
and if you are nervous on the train I suggest the
space outside your ventilator in the drawing-room.”</p>

<p>Tish’s indignation was intense. She wrote him
a very sharp letter, informing him that she was
now in the government service. “If the worst
comes,” she said, “I shall not hesitate to arrest
my own family. No Carberry has been jailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
yet for breaking the nation’s laws, but it is not
too late to begin.”</p>

<p>It may have been pure coincidence, but Lily
May ordered a hot-water bag from the mainland
soon after that. She said her feet got cold
at night.</p>

<p>I must confess Lily May puzzled us at that
time. She would not go fishing, but stayed at
home and insulted poor Christopher. She claimed
that he spent most of his time at the woodpile
smoking cigarettes, and so she would go out and
watch him. Hannah said that her manner to
him was really overbearing, and that she believed
she said quite insulting things to him under
her breath.</p>

<p>She counted the wood he cut too. Once
Hannah heard her say, “Twice two fifty
is five hundred. You’ve still five hundred to
go.”</p>

<p>And he groaned and said, “It’s the h—— of a
long way yet.”</p>

<p>She was very odd about the revenue matter,
also, and said very little when Tish got her
badge.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “it may stop a bullet. But
that’s all it will stop.”</p>

<p>As Tish said, such cynicism in the young was
really bewildering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It was the middle of July when Tish finally
started on her dangerous duty. Aggie had
begged to be left at home, but Tish had arranged
a duty for each of us.</p>

<p>“I shall steer the boat,” she said. “Aggie is
to lower and lift up the anchor, and you, Lizzie,
are to take charge of the fishing tackle and the
bait.”</p>

<p>We were, as I have said, to pretend to be fishing,
and thus avert the suspicion of the bootleggers.</p>

<p>Lily May and Christopher saw us off, and Lily
May’s farewell was characteristic of her.</p>

<p>“Pick out a good-looking rum runner for me,”
Lily May called. “I know father would love to
have one in the family.”</p>

<p>We had gone about three miles, I think, when I
heard a peculiar noise, like the rumbling of steam,
but no one else noticed it. A little later, however,
Aggie called out that there was a fountain playing
not far ahead. Tish at once announced that
it was a whale spouting, and changed our course
so as to avoid it.</p>

<p>We saw no more of it, and Aggie was beginning
to look white about the ears and the tip of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
the nose as usual, when Tish decided to drop our
anchor and there take up our position. She therefore
stopped the engine and Aggie heaved the
anchor overboard. But we did not stop.</p>

<p>“There’s certainly a very fast tide,” Tish said,
looking over the side. “We are going as fast as
before.”</p>

<p>“Then the bottom’s moving too,” Aggie said
sharply. “The anchor’s caught, all right.”</p>

<p>We looked about. Either we were moving out
to sea or Smith’s Island was going toward the
mainland and would soon collide with it. And
at that moment the front end of the boat dipped
down, shipping an enormous amount of sea,
and throwing us all forward, and then the entire
boat shot ahead as if it had been fired out of
a gun.</p>

<p>“It’s an earthquake, Tish,” Aggie groaned,
lying prone in the water.</p>

<p>Tish pulled herself to her knees and stared
about her.</p>

<p>“It may be a tidal wave,” she said. “But they
go in, not out.” She then stared again, forward,
and finally rose to her feet. I followed her, and
she lifted a shaking finger and pointed ahead.
Only a hundred feet or so from us, and heading
for Europe, was an enormous whale. One
point of our anchor had caught in his blowhole,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
and we were traveling at what I imagine was
sixty miles an hour or more.</p>

<p>“Really, Aggie,” Tish said, “this is a little
too much! I gave you the lightest duty on the
boat—simply to anchor this boat to the bottom.
Instead——”</p>

<p>“What did you want me to do?” Aggie demanded.
“Go down with it, and hook it to a
rock?”</p>

<p>“When I want a whale I’ll ask for a whale,”
said Tish with dignity. But with her usual alertness
she was already making a plan. She at once
started the engine and put it in reverse. “After
all,” she said, “we have the thing, and we may
as well try to take it in.”</p>

<p>But there was no perceptible effect, and after
a moment or so the engine choked, and would
not start again. Tish’s second thought, therefore,
of running at the whale and stunning it
until we could free ourselves, was not practical.
And the creature itself began to show signs
of extreme nervous irritation; it struck the
water really terrific blows with its enormous
broad flat tail, and Aggie remembered a moving
picture she had seen, where a whale had turned
in anger on a boat and had crushed it like a peanut
shell.</p>

<p>And to add to our difficulties there was a fishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
fleet ahead of us, and the creature was heading
directly for it. We went through that fleet
without touching a boat!</p>

<p>One fisherman yelled to us. “Better let go!”
he called. “If you do get him what’ll you do with
him?”</p>

<p>“If I ever get him,” Tish said grimly, “I’ll
know what to do with him.”</p>

<p>But of course the man was a mile behind us by
that time.</p>

<p>We had left the islands far behind us, and
the last bit of land was out of sight. With her
usual forethought Tish ordered us to put on our
life preservers, and after that we set to work to
endeavor to loosen the anchor rope from the ring
to which it was fastened.</p>

<p>But the tension was too great, and careful
search revealed no hatchet with which to cut ourselves
free. Our knife had gone overboard with
the first jerk. In this emergency my admiration
for Tish was never greater.</p>

<p>“One of two things will happen,” she said.
“Either he will go down to the sea bottom, taking
the boat with him, or he will strike for his
native haunts, which to the north whale is probably
the arctic region around Greenland. In the
first event, we have our life preservers; in the
second case, our sweaters. And as there is nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
more to do, we may as well have our
luncheon.”</p>

<p>Her courage was contagious, and while Aggie
spread the cloth on our folding table, I brought
out the sandwiches and coffee. I daresay the
schooner had been in sight for some time, just
ahead of us, before we noticed it, and Tish thinks
that the whale was too excited to see it at all.
Anyhow, we were within half a mile of it and
heading directly at it when we first saw it.</p>

<p>Aggie was the first to see what was happening,
and she ran forward and yelled to the other
boat to head him off. But there was no one in
sight on it, and the whale kept straight on.
Within a hundred feet or so, however, he suddenly
dived; the Swallow went on, however, striking
the other boat in the center, and the jar must
have loosened the anchor, for we remained on the
surface.</p>

<p>It was then that a man carefully peered over
the edge of the revenue boat and looked down
at us.</p>

<p>“My land!” he said. “I was just waiting for
you to explode!”</p>

<p>He then said that he had thought they had
been struck by a torpedo, and on Tish explaining,
he looked rather odd and brought two other
men to look at us. In the end, however, we convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
them, and they invited us on board while
they bailed our boat and fixed our engine.</p>

<p>The first man was the captain, and while Aggie
made us some fresh tea in the galley Tish confided
to him our real purpose, and showed him her
badge.</p>

<p>He seemed greatly impressed, and said, “If
more people would see their duty and do it, we
would get rid of the rum evil.”</p>

<p>He then said that they were also a part of
the revenue fleet, or had been. He didn’t know
how long they could stick it out.</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” he said. “But now you take
Joe and Bill, there. They’re not normal any
more; it’s the loneliness gets them. Nothing to
do but wait, you see.”</p>

<p>“You might try cross-word puzzles,” Tish
suggested.</p>

<p>“We had a book of them,” he said dejectedly.
“But Bill got mad one day trying to think of a
South American river, in five letters, and flung
it overboard.”</p>

<p>Over our tea Tish discoursed of the reasons
which had turned us from our original idea to
the revenue service, and the captain nodded his
head.</p>

<p>“I know Jerry,” he said. “Now you take us.
Wouldn’t you think we could fish out here, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
fill in our spare time? Not a bit of it. It’s my
belief Jerry’s running liquor, and he won’t let
a revenue boat near the wharf.”</p>

<p>But he had, he said, discovered a way to circumvent
Jerry. He and Bill and Joe fished, all
right, only they dried the fish and packed them
in boxes.</p>

<p>“Some day,” he said, “we’ll land those fish,
and old Jerry will find the market glutted. That’s
all; glutted.” He had, he said, a hundred boxes
in the hold already. “Only trouble is,” he went
on, “we’re getting overloaded. If a big sea comes
along, and one’s due most any time, they may
shift, and then where are we?”</p>

<p>It was just before we left, I remember, that he
asked us if we wouldn’t carry in a few boxes for
him and land them at a cove on our island, where
a friend of the captain’s was living alone. And
Tish agreed at once.</p>

<p>I have no wish to reflect on Tish; her motive,
then as later, was of the highest, and for Charlie
Sands to say what he does is most ungenerous.
At the same time, her reckless kindness led us into
serious trouble later on, and I hope will be a
lesson to her.</p>

<p>We not only took the boxes of fish to Al Smith,
at the cove, that day, but we made repeated excursions
to the revenue boat from that time on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
carrying back a dozen boxes or so at a time, and
taking out an occasional batch of Aggie’s doughnuts,
a parcheesi game, and once a bottle of blackberry
cordial.</p>

<p>“For <i>mal de mer</i>,” Tish said kindly as she
presented it, and it created a profound impression.
Bill and Joe seemed quite overcome, and
the captain was so moved that he had to walk
away and wipe his eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s not the gift,” he said later. “It’s the
thought.”</p>

<p>We had naturally not told Lily May. But
one day when Mr. Smith, the captain’s friend,
was unpacking the boxes of fish at the cove, who
should wander into sight but the child herself.</p>

<p>She came right up and looked at the boxes, and
said, “What’s that anyhow?”</p>

<p>“It’s dried fish,” said Tish. “And I’ll thank
you to say nothing about it.”</p>

<p>I must say she gave Tish a very strange
look.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “I only hope you’re getting
something out of it.”</p>

<p>“I am getting the pleasure of assisting people
who need assistance.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world you are!” said Lily May.
And after giving Mr. Smith a most unpleasant
look she went away again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>But the very next day, rounding the corner,
who should we see but Lily May at Smith’s
wharf, sitting on the edge of the boat and smiling,
and Mr. Smith talking in a very loud and
angry voice. Once he even seemed to shake his
fist at her, but she kept right on smiling.</p>

<p>She was certainly a queer child.</p>

<p>Then, one night early in August, we had another
visit from Mr. MacDonald. He said that
liquor was coming in from somewhere in quantities,
and that trucks on the mainland were distributing
it all over the country. I happened to
have my eye on Lily May, and she turned pale.
I said nothing to Tish, but from that time on
Aggie and I kept a watch on her, and I really
shudder to recall what we discovered. Night
after night our boat was going out; sometimes
with Christopher alone in it, and sometimes
with Lily May also. And on one such night we
quietly searched her room.</p>

<p>We knew she had practically no money, for
her mother had been afraid she would run away,
back to the Field boy. But under her mattress
we found three hundred and twenty dollars,
mostly in small bills!</p>

<p>I simply cannot record how we felt about it.
Especially as in other ways the child was really
quite lovable. She and Aggie had become great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
friends, and she would listen for hours while
Aggie told her of Mr. Wiggins. But on Aggie’s
endeavoring to discuss bootlegging with her she
would shut up like a clam. Aggie tried to draw
her out.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she said one day, “if we knew
some of the reasons behind bootlegging, we might
be more lenient.”</p>

<p>But there was no use trying to gain her confidence.
She only gave Aggie another of her
strange looks, and got up and went away.</p>

<p>Tish knew nothing of our worry, and day after
day we went out in the boat, watching for rum
runners. On Tuesdays and Fridays we made
our trips to the revenue boat, but on other days
Aggie and I fished, while Tish stood erect with
her glasses, sweeping the surface of the sea. She
was particularly severe with the lobster men, and
after showing her badge would search their boats
carefully. On one such occasion a lobster fastened
itself to her and remained unnoticed until
Aggie gave a terrible scream. She had sat down
on the thing.</p>

<p>But mostly life in the Swallow moved quietly
enough. Aggie worked at a bag she was making
out of steel beads, with a fishing line looped
around her arm; a habit she was obliged to alter,
after a very large fish one day unexpectedly took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
her hook and but for Tish’s presence of mind in
grasping her feet would have taken her overboard.
And I did most of my Christmas fancy-work.</p>

<p>And thus things were up to the twenty-ninth
of August, a day, or rather a night, which none
of us will ever forget. At two o’clock that afternoon
three of us started out; at four in the morning
I returned home alone, in such agony of spirit
as can only be imagined when the facts are
known.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>It was our day to go out to the revenue boat,
and there were indications of a fog. Poor Aggie
did not want to go. It was as though she had a
premonition of trouble, but Tish insisted, and
even took along some seasick remedy. Aggie,
who has been somewhat bitter since, should remember
that, and the real kindness which lay behind
it.</p>

<p>We made jelly in the morning, so it was late
when we started, and the fog was fairly thick
already. But Tish took along a compass, and we
started at two p.m. For once Lily May insisted
on going along, although the sea was very rough,
and she flirted quite dreadfully with the captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
of the revenue boat while Joe and Bill were loading.</p>

<p>But she was seasick on the way back, and so
was Aggie. I took the lookout, therefore, and
it must have been four or five miles from land
that I saw something straight ahead in the fog,
and Tish turned out just in time to avoid a bell
buoy. It was not ringing!</p>

<p>Tish at once stopped and examined it. It consisted
of a small platform above which rose a
superstructure with a bell at the top, and clappers
which struck the bell as the sea moved it this way
and that. But the bell had fallen down and now
lay on the platform.</p>

<p>“This is a very serious matter,” Tish said.
“This buoy is here to save our shipping. Undoubtedly
it marks a reef. And now when it is
most needed its warning voice is stilled.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d still your own voice, Tish,”
Aggie groaned. “Or else get out on it and yell
ding-dong.”</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate suggestion. Aggie was
taking a dose of her remedy for sea-sickness
at the moment, and she did not see Tish’s
eyes as they traveled from her to me, but I
did.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t do it, Lizzie,” she said. “You’re
too stout. But Aggie could.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“Could what?” said Aggie, giving her a cold
glance.</p>

<p>“Your duty,” said Tish gravely. “That bell
must ring, Aggie. The fog is intense, and all
about are—or may be—men who depend on its
warning signal for their lives. Can we fail
them?”</p>

<p>“I can,” said Aggie shortly.</p>

<p>Lily May said it was all nonsense, but “Give
me a hammer and I’ll do it,” she said. “I suppose
I can stick it out for an hour or so, and after
that I dare say I’ll not care.”</p>

<p>But Tish said the child was in her care, and
she was to stay just where she was. And in the
end Aggie crawled onto the bell buoy, and we
placed one of the boxes on the platform as a seat
for her.</p>

<p>“It will take only a short time,” were Tish’s
final words, “to get to the coast-guard station.
We shall return at once.”</p>

<p>But it was a painful sight, as we moved away, to
see our poor Aggie thus marooned, watching us
into the fog with wistful eyes and ever and anon
striking the bell with the hammer as she sat on
the box.</p>

<p>I did not see her again until three o’clock the
next morning!</p>

<p>It was when we had gone about six miles by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
Tish’s watch, while I watched the compass, that
Tish suddenly announced something was wrong.</p>

<p>“Either we’ve missed the land altogether,
Lizzie,” she said, “or we’ve passed right over the
Baptist church and are now at Graham’s grocery
store.”</p>

<p>I handed the compass to her, but the moment
she took it the needle turned about and continued
pointing toward me. It was very unusual, and
Tish stared at me with a justifiable irritation.</p>

<p>“Don’t stand there pretending you’re the magnetic
pole,” she snapped. “Move around, and see
what the dratted thing will do.”</p>

<p>Well, wherever I went that needle pointed at
me. As events proved, for Tish to blame it on
my gold tooth was quite unjustified, but it was
not until in a burst of irritation she had flung it
overboard that we discovered the true cause.</p>

<p>Aggie’s workbag, containing a magnet for
picking up steel beads, was on my arm.</p>

<p>All the time the fog was growing thicker, so
that we could not see ten feet in any direction.
And although we kept moving we never seemed
to arrive anywhere. Once, indeed, I thought I
heard faintly the sound of Aggie’s hammer striking
the bell, but it was very feeble and soon died
away.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock it was already dark, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
had just two gallons of gasoline left. Tish shut
off the engine and we considered our position.</p>

<p>“If we use all our gasoline the tide will carry
us straight out to sea, and we may never get
back,” she said.</p>

<p>“And Aggie!” I said. “Our poor Aggie!”</p>

<p>“Aggie is all right,” she said impatiently. “At
least she doesn’t have to get anywhere. We do.”</p>

<p>We decided at last until the fog lifted to save
our gasoline, in case we had to get out of the way
of some vessel; and Tish—who can knit quite well
in the dark—got out her work. But Lily May
seemed to have recovered, and was acting very
strangely.</p>

<p>For instance, she roused once from deep thought
to suggest that we throw the boxes of fish overboard,
and she seemed quite worried when Tish
refused.</p>

<p>“Why should I?” Tish said. “They represent
money and effort. They have a certain value.”</p>

<p>Lily May muttered something about a thousand
dollars and ten years, which I did not catch, and
then became silent once more. But when, about
seven o’clock, we all heard the engine of a boat not
far off and Tish was for hailing it at once, she
sharply said we’d better not.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Tish, and had started to call
when Lily May put a hand over her mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“Haven’t you any sense?” she demanded. “It
may be a revenue boat.”</p>

<p>“And what if it is?” said Tish.</p>

<p>Lily May sat down on the edge of a thwart and
stared at us.</p>

<p>“Look here,” she said, “is the little old bean
gone, or has that shot of blackberry cordial gone
to my head? What about this stuff you’re loaded
with?”</p>

<p>“If there is any fine connected with running
fish,” Tish said shortly, “I have yet to hear of it.”</p>

<p>“Fish!” said Lily May in a disgusted tone.
“I could do better than that myself. Why not
canned corn? Or artificial legs? Or bunion
plasters?”</p>

<p>“Fish,” Tish repeated. “Dried fish. And if
you dare to intimate——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be so silly!” said Lily May, and
yawned. “Now see here, you may be older than
I am in years, but I was old when I was born.
And I can’t remember the time when I didn’t
know whiskey from fish.”</p>

<p>“Whiskey!” said Tish in a terrible voice.</p>

<p>“Booze,” said Lily May. “You’re loaded to the
gunwales with booze. You’ve landed, so far,
about a hundred cases of first-grade Canadian
Club, and if you haven’t made more than I have
out of it you’ve been stung. That’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>Tish got up at that and gave her a really terrible
look.</p>

<p>“You have made money out of this iniquitous
traffic?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, a bagatelle,” Lily May replied languidly.
“I had to protect you, you see. If you will run
liquor——”</p>

<p>“Silence!” Tish thundered. “What have you
made?”</p>

<p>“I got three hundred for keeping Christopher
busy while you unloaded,” she said a trifle sulkily.</p>

<p>“Christopher?” Tish said in a dazed manner.</p>

<p>“He’s in the revenue service,” said Lily May.
“So am I, for that matter. There’s been hardly
a day since we came when I couldn’t have arrested
you all. But it would have upset mother a lot.
If you don’t believe me——”</p>

<p>She turned up her skirt, and I shall never forget
Tish’s eyes when she saw what I saw. That
chit had her revenue badge pinned to the top of
her stocking!</p>

<p>It was after that that our dear Tish was taken
with a sudden shuddering spell and we had to give
her quite a heavy dose of blackberry cordial. It is
possible that in the darkness we gave her more
than we intended, on an empty stomach, and there
is undoubtedly a small percentage of alcohol in it
to preserve it. When, later on, she insisted on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
opening one of the boxes and on tasting its contents
before she would be entirely convinced, the
combination was unfortunate.</p>

<p>She lapsed into silence soon after that, rousing
once to shed a few tears, a most unusual proceeding
for her, and with her voice slightly thickened
she said, “We have been ushed by those sons of
Belial, Lizzie. I musht think of a way to shettle
with them.”</p>

<p>She dozed a little then, but shortly thereafter
she wakened and said a sea serpent had just
stuck its head up beside her, and what if it should
find Aggie? I was greatly alarmed, but Lily May
was quite calm.</p>

<p>“She’s only slightly binged,” she said, “but she
will sleep it off. Do her good probably; like
having a good cry.”</p>

<p>I pass over the next few hours. Tish slept,
and we drifted about at the mercy of wind and
tide. About midnight a gale came up and gave
us considerable trouble, as the boxes kept shifting.
Lily May once more suggested flinging them overboard,
but I dared not do this without Tish’s
consent, and when I roused her and asked
her she gave me no satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Shertainly not,” she said. “It’s evidench.
Never destroy evidench, Lizzie.”</p>

<p>“She’ll snap out of it after a while,” Lily May<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
comforted me. “But she’s sure gifted. I’ll bet
a brandied peach would give her the D.T.’s.”</p>

<p>I was about to reprove her when I suddenly
perceived that the wind had lifted the fog, and
there was even a pale moonlight. And at that,
Lily May clutched my arm and pointed ahead.</p>

<p>We had indeed been drifting with the tide, and
the schooner was just ahead, within a hundred
yards or so. We were moving slowly toward
it.</p>

<p>I wakened Tish, and this time she responded.
I can still see her, majestic and calm, clutching
the rail and staring ahead. I can still hear the
ringing tone of her voice when she said, “The
hour of vengeance is at hand, Lizzie.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world it is, if you go up there,”
said Lily May.</p>

<p>But she brushed the child aside, and immediately
Bill yelled from the schooner, “Stand by, there!
What do you want?”</p>

<p>“We’re looking for trouble, Bill,” said Lily
May. “If you have any around——”</p>

<p>But Bill recognized her voice, and he smiled
down at us.</p>

<p>“Trouble’s my middle name, ladies,” he said.
“Come up and make yourselves at home. Hi,
cap!” he shouted. “Here’s company.”</p>

<p>I had not an idea of what was in the wind until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
I saw Tish pick up her knitting bag. Her revolver
was in it.</p>

<p>How can I relate what followed? Tish went
up first, Lily May was on the ladder, and I was
in the very act of tying up, our rope in my hands,
when I heard Tish say, “Hands up! You are
under arrest.”</p>

<p>Immediately on that, a most terrible uproar
broke out above, and a shot rang out. Just after
that my poor Tish’s revolver fell into the
boat with a terrible thud, and so startled me that
I let go of the rope. There was a frightful noise
going on overhead, and as I drifted away I heard
another shot or two, and then the captain’s voice.</p>

<p>“I’ve got her, the h—— cat!” he called.
“Start the engine, Bill. We’d better get out of
here.”</p>

<p>And the next minute the engine of the schooner
was starting and they were getting the anchor
up. The schooner was moving away.</p>

<p>I cannot write my sensations without pain.
The schooner starting off; my dear Tish a prisoner
on that accursed boat, helpless, possibly
injured; and Lily May, who had been placed in
our care, on that accursed vessel.</p>

<p>I stood up and called.</p>

<p>“Tish!” I said in agony. “Tish, where are
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“I am here, Lizzie,” I heard the dear familiar
tones. And that was all.</p>

<p>In a few moments I was alone on the bosom
of the raging deep, and Tish and Lily May were
on their way probably to the Canadian border.</p>

<p>I have no very clear idea of what happened
next. As I had no knowledge of a motor I could
but experiment, and finally about two a.m. I did
start the engine. I managed the steering fairly
well after a time, and started back. The fog was
quite gone by that time, and it was clear moonlight.
I seemed to be going very fast, but I did
not know how to stop the thing and could but
keep on. I have one very clear and tragic impression,
however. In the moonlight I passed
the bell buoy where we had left Aggie—and Aggie
was not there!</p>

<p>After that I remember little, except seeing our
beach in front of me with a group of people on it,
and steering at it. They have told me since that
I came in on the top of a high roller, and that the
Swallow simply crossed the beach and went up
onto the lawn, where it stopped finally in the pansy
bed, but I did not.</p>

<p>And then Christopher was lifting my head from
a bottle of Canadian Club whiskey as I lay on the
ground, and saying in a shaken voice, “Where is
she?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“Gone,” I said sadly. “They are all gone,
Christopher. Tish and Aggie and Lily May.
Gone.”</p>

<p>“My God!” he said. “Lily May!”</p>

<p>“Canada,” I said. “Or maybe England; or
Spain. I don’t know. But Aggie——”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” yelled Christopher.
“Canada or England?”</p>

<p>“They’ve been stolen. Abducted. By rum
runners, Christopher,” I said. “But my dear
Aggie——”</p>

<p>And at that minute I heard a sneeze from the
house.</p>

<p>“Aggie!” I cried. “Aggie!”</p>

<p>Then Hannah and Mr. MacDonald came up.
Mr. MacDonald picked up a bottle and said, “You
wouldn’t believe me before. Is this eau de cologne
or is it liquor?”</p>

<p>“Oh, get the h—— out of here,” said Christopher.</p>

<p>They took me into the house, and there was
Aggie sitting before the fire, still shivering, and
with a very bad cold. She had her feet in a
mustard foot bath with a blanket over it, for Mr.
MacDonald would not allow her to go upstairs,
and she burst into tears the minute she saw me.</p>

<p>“I’b udder arrest, Lizzie,” she wailed. “I’ve
beed soaked through, ad bit at by sharks, ad fired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
od, ad lost by teeth. Ad dow I’b arrested. It’s
just too buch.”</p>

<p>She had lost her teeth, poor soul. She had
taken them out because they were chattering so,
and they had slipped out of her hand. She might
have recovered them, but just as she was about
to do so a huge fish had snapped at them and got
them.</p>

<p>It had indeed been a day of misfortunes, and
Aggie’s were not the least. For Mr. MacDonald
and Christopher had heard her sneezing on the
bell buoy, and had fired at her before they knew
her.</p>

<p>Then, when they did find her, she was sitting
on a case of liquor, and nothing she could say did
any good.</p>

<p>“I told theb it was dried fish,” she said, “but the
darded fools wouldd’t believe be, ad whed they
looked, it wasd’t.”</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>As soon as possible Christopher and Mr. MacDonald
had aroused the island, and every possible
boat had started out. I telegraphed to Charlie
Sands also, and he was on his way by the first
train.</p>

<p>But all the next day went by, and no sign of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
schooner or of Tish and Lily May. And as Aggie
said, sitting up in bed with a bowl of junket—she
could only eat soft food, poor thing—“We bay
dever see theb agaid, Lizzie. They bay have to
walk the plak or sobethig.”</p>

<p>I spent all my time on the beach, awaiting news,
and at evening Charlie Sands arrived from the
mainland. He came over to me as I sat disconsolately
on a rock, cutting up fish and feeding the
sea gulls as our poor Tish had always done, and
listened to my story.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said when I had finished, “how
many men were on that boat?”</p>

<p>“Three.”</p>

<p>“Three,” he repeated thoughtfully. “And my
dear Aunt Letitia and Lily May. Is that correct?”</p>

<p>“And boxes and boxes of-f—of liquor,
Charlie.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry about the liquor,” he said.
“I imagine by this time——” He hesitated and
sighed. “It seems rather a pity, in a way. Still——”</p>

<p>“A pity!” I said angrily. “Your Aunt Letitia
and Lily May Carter abducted, and you say it is
a pity!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he apologized. “Just for the
moment my mind had wandered. Now let’s see.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
They’ve had eighteen hours, and the percentage
was favorable. I rather think—of course, I’m
not sure—but I rather think it’s about time something
happened.”</p>

<p>He then rose to his feet and looked out over
the water, and said, “What kind of a boat was
it anyhow?”</p>

<p>“It was a schooner.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said. “It would be a schooner,
naturally. And while I am not a betting man, I’ll
wager ten dollars against a bottle of blackberry
cordial that this is it now.”</p>

<p>I leaped to my feet, and there, coming around
the point of our cove, was the revenue boat! I
could only stand and stare. Our beloved Tish was
at the helm, and as we gazed she shouted to Lily
May, who at once shoved the anchor overboard.
As all the sails were still up, the boat listed heavily
to one side, but it stopped.</p>

<p>There was no one else in sight, and this seemed
to make Charlie Sands somewhat uneasy.</p>

<p>“By the gods,” he said, “she’s done away with
them!”</p>

<p>But this proved to be erroneous. Our dear
Tish, having brought the vessel to a halt,
straightened her bonnet, and then drawing the
small boat which trailed behind to the foot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
the rope ladder, she and Lily May got into it and
Tish rowed it to the shore.</p>

<p>Her first words were typical.</p>

<p>“I want a policeman, Lizzie,” she said briefly,
“and a room in the jail, and a bath.”</p>

<p>“I doubt if the jails are arranged that way,”
said Charlie Sands, coming forward. “Still, we
can inquire.”</p>

<p>She had not noticed him before, and his presence
startled her. I have never seen our Tish
flinch, but she very nearly did so then. And she
gave Lily May a curious look.</p>

<p>“I have taken three prisoners,” she said with
dignity. “They are locked in, down below in that
ship. And here’s the key, for Mr. MacDonald.”</p>

<p>She then felt in her workbag, handed a key to
Charlie Sands, and started with dignity to the
house. Charlie Sands looked at the key and then
called after her.</p>

<p>“Is that all you’ve got?” he said.</p>

<p>She stiffened and glared at him.</p>

<p>“If you mean the curse of this nation, rum,”
she said coldly, “I have thrown it overboard.”</p>

<p>“Not every bottle?” he said in a pleading voice.</p>

<p>“Every bottle,” she said, and walked firmly into
the house.</p>

<p>Lily May did not follow her. She stood eying
Charlie Sands through her long lashes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>“Well?” she said. “Doesn’t papa still love
mamma?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you that,” he said sternly, “when you
tell me something else.” He then stooped and
picked up a one-hundred-dollar bill which was
lying on the grass. “Where did this come
from?”</p>

<p>“Well, well?” said Lily May. “You are lucky,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t look at me like that,” said Charlie Sands.
“Where did this come from?”</p>

<p>“They grow around here,” said Lily May cheerfully.
“Not everywhere, but here and there, you
know. Like four-leaf clovers.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t by any chance drop from my Aunt
Tish’s workbag?”</p>

<p>“Well, you might call up and inquire,” she suggested,
and sauntered off to the house.</p>

<p>She spent an hour and a quarter getting dressed
that evening, and when the Swallow and Christopher
came back, Christopher almost crazy, she
was sitting on the veranda doing her finger nails.</p>

<p>Hannah was laying the table inside, and she
says she greeted him with “Hello, old egg! And
how are things?”</p>

<p>And that fool of a boy just got down on his
knees and put his head in her lap and his arms
around her; and when he looked up he said, “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
little devil! I’ve a good notion to turn you over
my knee and spank you.”</p>

<p>As Aggie says, it was queer love-making, and
there is no use trying to understand the younger
generation.</p>

<p>“Under no circumstances,” she says, “would
Mr. Wiggins have threatened me with that.
But then,” she adds, “Mr. Wiggins would never
have put on those dreadful clothes and pretended
to be something he wasn’t either. Times have
changed, Lizzie.”</p>

<p>For it turned out, that very night, that Christopher
was Billy Field.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Never, so long as I live, shall I forget that
evening around Aggie’s bed, when Tish told her
story. The bootleggers had tied her up at once,
and even Lily May also. But Lily May was so
quiet and chastened that they had weakened, after
a while, and had let her loose.</p>

<p>“And then what did you do?” asked Charlie
Sands.</p>

<p>“I amused them,” she said, not looking at Tish.</p>

<p>“I think,” Tish said in a terrible voice, “the
less said of that the better.”</p>

<p>But it appears—for one must be frank—that
Lily May saw that Tish was working with her
ropes, and so she began to tell them stories. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
must have been very queer ones, for Tish has
never reverted to the subject.</p>

<p>“I told them the flapper story,” she said to
Charlie Sands, “and that new Ford one, and the
April-fool joke.”</p>

<p>Charlie Sands seemed to understand, for he
nodded.</p>

<p>“Pretty fair,” he said.</p>

<p>But it seems they relaxed after that, and then
she got them started on mixing different kinds of
drinks. She would say, Did you ever try this and
that, with a drop of something else floated on the
top? And she would taste the things they
brought, and they would take the rest.</p>

<p>“It was Bill who went under first. He went
asleep standing up,” she said. And the captain
next. But by that time Tish had freed herself,
and she knocked Joe out with a piece of chain
that was handy. And then their troubles were
over, for they only had to drag them down below
and lock them up. But they had been banging at
the door all day, and Tish had had to make them
keep quiet. She had the captain’s revolver by
that time, and now and again she fired a bullet
into the door frame, and they would hush up for
an hour or so. Then they would start again.</p>

<p>Our dear Tish finished her narrative and then
rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“And now,” she said brightly, “it is time for
bed. I have done my duty, and shall sleep with
a clear conscience.”</p>

<p>“Are you so sure of that?” said Charlie Sands,
and fixed her with a cold eye.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Tish asked tartly.</p>

<p>“One reason might be—piracy on the high
seas.”</p>

<p>“Piracy!” said Tish furiously. “I capture
three rum runners, and you call it piracy?”</p>

<p>“Then there’s no matter of money to be discussed.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” said Tish.</p>

<p>“Of seventeen hundred and forty-one dollars,”
he insisted. “At the present moment concealed
in your bedroom.”</p>

<p>“That money belongs to the church.”</p>

<p>“I see. But the amount interests me. I can
understand the seventeen hundred, and even the
forty. But why the one?”</p>

<p>“Two months at eight hundred and seventy
dollars and fifty cents per month,” Tish said,
staring at him defiantly. “Even an idiot could
figure that.”</p>

<p>“And you took it from those bootleggers?”</p>

<p>“I’d earned it for them.”</p>

<p>“By force and duress?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort. The man was asleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“Hijacking,” he said softly. “Ye gods and
little fishes! Hijacking for the church!”</p>

<p>He seemed a trifle dazed, although Tish carefully
explained her position to him.</p>

<p>“I see it all,” he said. “It sounds all right, but
there must be a catch in it somewhere. I don’t
quite grasp it, that’s all.”</p>

<p>After a time, however, he got up and went to
the door, still thinking, and called Christopher.</p>

<p>“Come in, you young imposter,” he said, “and
tell us how much you’ve had out of the summer.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t quite make it,” said Christopher
sadly. “Five hundred for the boat and two hundred
revenue salary. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Certainly it’s not all, Billy Field!” said Lily
May. “I have three hundred from Smith, haven’t
I? That makes the thousand.”</p>

<p>But Charlie Sands was holding his head.</p>

<p>“It sounds all right,” he said. “The parish
house gets a kitchen, and Field gets Lily May.
Personally I think my Aunt Tish ought to get
thirty years, but still——” He groaned. “Rum
running, assault and battery, piracy, straight larceny
and hijacking!” he said. “And everybody’s
happy! There’s a profound immorality somewhere,”
he added, looking around at us. “But
where?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>He got up feebly. “I’m getting too old for
much of this,” he said. “Get me a stiff dose of
blackberry cordial, somebody. And, Field, slip
around to old MacDonald’s and get a bit of something
to float on the top.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_TREASURE_HUNT">THE TREASURE HUNT</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Had we not been so anxious about our dear
Tish last summer, I dare say it would never
have happened. But even Charlie Sands noticed
when he came to our cottage at Lake Penzance
for the week-end that she was distinctly not her
old self.</p>

<p>“I don’t like it,” he said. “She’s lost her pep,
or something. I’ve been here two days and she
hasn’t even had a row with Hannah, and I must
say that fuss with old Carpenter yesterday really
wasn’t up to her standard at all.”</p>

<p>Old Carpenter is a fisherman, and Tish having
discovered that our motor boat went better in
reverse than forward, he had miscalculated our
direction and we had upset him.</p>

<p>As it happened, that very evening Tish herself
confirmed Charlie’s fears by asking about Aggie’s
Cousin Sarah Brown’s Chelsea teapot.</p>

<p>“I think,” she said, “that a woman of my age
should have a hobby; one that will arouse interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
at the minimum of physical exertion. And the
collection of old china——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tish!” Aggie wailed, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>“I mean it,” said Tish, “I have reached that
period of my life which comes to every woman,
when adventure no longer lurks around the next
corner. By this I do not refer necessarily to
amorous affairs, but to dramatic incidents. I
think more than I did of what I eat. I take a
nap every day. I am getting old.”</p>

<p>“Never!” said Aggie valiantly.</p>

<p>“No? When I need my glasses nowadays to
see the telephone directory!”</p>

<p>“But they’re printing the names smaller, Tish.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I dare say my arm is getting shorter
also,” she returned with a sad smile. She pursued
the subject no further, however, but went on
knitting the bedroom slippers which are
her yearly contribution to the Old Ladies’
Home, leaving Charlie Sands to gaze at her
thoughtfully as he sipped his blackberry cordial.</p>

<p>But the fact is that Tish had outgrown the cottage
life at Penzance, and we all knew it. Save
for an occasional golf ball from the links breaking
a window now and then, and the golfers themselves
who brought extra shoes done up in paper
for us to keep for them, paying Hannah something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
to put them on the ice, there was nothing to
rouse or interest her.</p>

<p>Her mind was as active as ever; it was her
suggestion that a clothespin on Aggie’s nose
might relieve the paroxysms of her hay fever,
and she was still filled with sentiment. It was
her own idea on the anniversary of Mr. Wiggins’
demise to paint the cottage roof a fresh and
verdant green as a memorial to him, since he had
been a master roofer by profession.</p>

<p>But these had been the small and simple annals
of her days. To all outward seeming, until the
night of the treasure hunt, our Tish was no longer
the Tish who with our feeble assistance had captured
the enemy town of X—— during the war,
or held up the band of cutthroats on Thundercloud,
or led us through the wilderness of the Far
West. An aëroplane in the sky or the sound of
the Smith boys racing along in their stripped
flivver may have reminded her of brighter days,
but she said nothing.</p>

<p>Once, indeed, she had hired a horse from the
local livery stable and taken a brief ride, but
while making a short cut across the Cummings
estate the animal overturned a beehive. Although
Tish, with her customary presence of mind, at
once headed the terrified creature for the swimming
pool, where a number of persons were bathing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
and sunning themselves in scanty apparel
about the edge, the insects forsook the beast the
moment horse and rider plunged beneath the
surface and a great many people were severely
stung. Indeed, the consequences threatened to
be serious, for Tish was unable to get the horse
out again and it was later necessary to bring a
derrick from Penzance to rescue him. But her protests
over the enormous bills rendered by the livery
man were feeble, indeed, compared to the old days.</p>

<p>“Twenty dollars!” she said. “Are you claiming
that that animal, which should have been able
to jump over a beehive without upsetting it, was
out ten hours?”</p>

<p>“That’s my charge,” he said. “Walk, trot and
canter is regular rates, but swimming is double,
and cheap at that. The next time you want to
go out riding, go to the fish pier and I reckon
they’ll oblige you. You don’t need a horse, lady.
What you want is a blooming porpoise.”</p>

<p>Which, of course, is preposterous. There are
no porpoises in Lake Penzance.</p>

<p>She even made the blackberry cordial that year,
a domestic task usually left to Aggie and myself,
but I will say with excellent results. For just
as it was ready for that slight fermentation
which gives it its medicinal quality, a very pleasant
young man came to see us, having for sale a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
fluid to be added to homemade cordials and so on,
which greatly increased their bulk without weakening
them.</p>

<p>“But how can one dilute without weakening?”
Tish demanded suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I would not call it dilution, madam. It is
really expansion.”</p>

<p>It was a clear colorless liquid with a faintly
aromatic odor, which he said was due to juniper
in it, and he left us a small bottle for experimental
purposes.</p>

<p>With her customary caution, our dear Tish
would not allow us to try it until it had been
proved, and some days later Hannah reporting a
tramp at the back door, she diluted—or rather
expanded—a half glass of cordial, gave him some
cookies with it, and we all waited breathlessly.</p>

<p>It had no ill effect, however. The last we saw
of the person he was quite cheery; and, indeed,
we heard later that he went into Penzance, and
getting one of the town policemen into an alley,
forced him to change trousers with him. As a
matter of record, whether it was Tish’s efforts
with the cordial itself, or the addition of the expansion
matter which we later purchased in bulk
and added, I cannot say. But I do know that on
one occasion, having run out of gasoline, we
poured a bottle of our blackberry cordial into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
tank of the motor boat and got home very nicely
indeed. I believe that this use of fruit juices has
not heretofore been generally known.</p>

<p>Tish, I know, told it to Mr. Stubbs, the farmer
who brought us our poultry, advising him to try
cider in his car instead of feeding his apples to
his hogs. But he only stared at her.</p>

<p>“Feed apples to hogs these days!” he said.
“Why, lady, my hogs ain’t seen an apple for four
years! They don’t know there is such a thing.”</p>

<p>Occupied with these small and homely duties
then, we went on along the even tenor of our
way through July and August, and even into
September. In August, Charlie Sands sent us a
radio, and thereafter it was our custom at 7:20
<span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to carry our comforters into Tish’s bedroom
and do divers exercises in loose undergarments.</p>

<p>It is to this training that I lay Tish’s ability to
go through the terrible evening which followed
with nothing more serious than a crack in a floating
rib.</p>

<p>And in September Charlie Sands himself week-ended
with us, as I have said; with the result of
a definite break in our monotony and a revival of
Tish’s interest in life which has not yet begun to
fade.</p>

<p>Yet his visit itself was uneventful enough. It
was not until Mrs. Ostermaier’s call on Saturday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
evening that anything began to develop. I
remember the evening most distinctly. Our dear
Tish was still in her dressing gown, after a very
unpleasant incident of the morning, when she had
inflated a pair of water wings and gone swimming.
Unluckily, when some distance out she
had endeavored to fasten the water wings with
a safety pin to her bathing garments and the air
at once began to escape. When Charlie Sands
reached the spot only a few bubbles showed
where our unfortunate Tish had been engulfed.
She had swallowed a great deal of water, and he
at once suggested bailing her out.</p>

<p>“By and large,” he said, “I’ve been bailing you
out for the last ten years. Why not now?”</p>

<p>But she made no response save to say that she
had swallowed a fish. “Get me a doctor,” she
said thickly. “I can feel the thing wriggling.”</p>

<p>“Doctor nothing!” he told her. “What you
need is a fisherman, if that’s the case.”</p>

<p>But she refused to listen to him, saying that
if she was meant to be an aquarium she would be
one; and seeing she was firm, he agreed.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said cheerfully. “But why not
do the thing right while you’re about it? How
about some pebbles and a tadpole or two?”</p>

<p>The result of all this was that Tish, although
later convinced there was no fish, was in an uncertain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
mood that evening as we sat about the
radio. She had, I remember, got Chicago, where
a lady at some hotel was singing By the Waters
of Minnetonka. Turning away from Chicago,
she then got Detroit, Michigan, and a woman
there was singing the same thing.</p>

<p>Somewhat impatiently, she next picked up Atlanta,
Georgia, where a soprano was also singing
it, and the same thing happened with
Montreal, Canada. With a strained look, our
dear Tish then turned to the national capital, and
I shall never forget her expression when once
more the strains of Minnetonka rang out on the
evening air.</p>

<p>With an impatient gesture, she shoved the box
away from her, and the various batteries and so
on fell to the floor. And at that moment Mrs.
Ostermaier came in breathless, and said that she
and Mr. Ostermaier had just got Denver, and
heard it quite distinctly.</p>

<p>“A woman was singing,” she said. “Really,
Miss Carberry, we could hear every word. She
was singing——”</p>

<p>“The Waters of Minnetonka?” asked Tish.</p>

<p>“Why, however did you guess it?”</p>

<p>It was probably an accident, but as Tish got
up suddenly, her elbow struck the box itself, and
the box fell with a horrible crash. Tish never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
even looked at it, but picked up her knitting and
fell to work on a bedroom slipper, leaving Mrs.
Ostermaier free to broach her plan.</p>

<p>For, as it turned out, she had come on an errand.
She and Mr. Ostermaier wished to know
if we could think of any way to raise money and
put a radio in the state penitentiary, which was
some miles away along the lake front.</p>

<p>“Think,” she said, “of the terrible monotony of
their lives there! Think of the effect of the sweetness
disseminated by Silver Threads Among the
Gold or By the Waters of——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wiggins always said that music had
power to soothe the savage breast,” Aggie put in
hastily. “Have you thought of any plan?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ostermaier suggested that Miss Tish
might think of something. She is so fertile.”</p>

<p>But Tish’s reaction at first was unfavorable.</p>

<p>“Why?” she said. “We’ve made our jails so
pleasant now that there’s a crime wave so people
can get into them.” But she added, “I’m in favor
of putting one in every prison if they’d hire a
woman to sing The Waters of Minnetonka all
day and all night. If that wouldn’t stop this rush
to the penitentiaries, nothing will.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, Charlie Sands regarded
the idea favorably. He sat sipping a glass of
cordial and thinking, and at last said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“Why not? Think of an entire penitentiary
doing the morning daily dozen! Or laying out
bridge hands, according to radio instructions!
Broaden ’em. Make ’em better citizens. Send
’em out fit to meet the world again. Darned good
idea—Silver Threads Among the Gold for the
burglars and Little Brown Jug for the bootleggers.
Think of Still as the Night for the moonshiners,
too, and the bedtime stories for the cradle
snatchers. Why, it’s got all sorts of possibilities!”</p>

<p>He then said to leave it to him and he would
think up something; and falling to work on the
radio, soon had it in operation again. His speech
had evidently had a quieting effect on Tish, and
when the beautiful strains of The Waters of Minnetonka
rang out once more she merely placed
her hands over her ears and said nothing.</p>

<p>It was after his departure on Monday that
he wrote us the following note, and succeeded
in rousing our dear Tish:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Beloved Maiden Ladies</i>: I have been considering
the problem of the radio for our unfortunate
convicts. How about a treasure hunt—à
la Prince of Wales—to raise the necessary
lucre? I’ll write the clews and bury a bag of
pennies—each entrant to pay five dollars, and the
profits to go to the cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“Oil up the old car and get out the knickerbockers,
for it’s going to be a tough job. And
don’t forget, I’m betting on you. Read the
Murders in the Rue Morgue for clews and deductive
reasoning. And pass me the word when
you’re ready.</p>

<p class="right">
Devotedly, C.S.”<br>
</p>

<p>“P.S. My usual terms are 20 per cent, but will
take two bottles of cordial instead. Please mark
‘Preserves’ on box.</p>

<p class="right">
C.”<br>
</p>
</div>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>We saw an immediate change in Tish from
that moment. The very next morning we put on
our bathing suits and, armed with soap and
sponges, drove the car into the lake for a washing.
Unluckily a wasp stung Tish on the bare
knee as we advanced and she stepped on the gas
with great violence, sending us out a considerable
distance, and, indeed, rendering it necessary to
crawl out and hold to the top to avoid drowning.</p>

<p>Here we were marooned for some time, until
Hannah spied us and rowed out to us. It was
finally necessary to secure three horses and a long
rope to retrieve the car, and it was some days in
drying out.</p>

<p>But aside from these minor matters, things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
went very well. Mr. Ostermaier, who was not
to search, took charge of the hunt from our end
and reported numerous entrants from among
the summer colony, and to each entrant the following
was issued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The cars of the treasure hunters will meet
at the Rectory on Saturday evening at eight
o’clock.</p>

<p>2. Each hunter will receive a password or
sentence, and a sealed envelope containing the
first clew.</p>

<p>3. This clew found, another password and fresh
sealed envelope will be discovered. And so on.</p>

<p>4. There are six clews.</p>

<p>5. Participants are requested to use care in
driving about the country, as the local police force
has given notice that it will be stationed at various
points to prevent reckless driving.</p>

<p>6. After the treasure is discovered, the hunt
will please meet at the Rectory, where light refreshments
will be served. It is requested that
if possible the search be over before midnight in
order not to infringe on the Sabbath day.</p>
</div>

<p>In view of the fact that certain persons,
especially Mrs. Cummings—who should be the
last to complain—have accused Tish of certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
unethical acts during that terrible night, I wish to
call attention to certain facts:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(a) We obeyed the above rules to the letter,
save possibly Number Five.</p>

<p>(b) There was no actual identification of the
scissors.</p>

<p>(c) If there was a box of carpet tacks in our
car, neither Aggie nor I saw them.</p>

<p>(d) The fish pier had been notoriously rotten
for years.</p>

<p>(e) We have paid for the repairs to the
motorcycle, and so on.</p>

<p>(f) Doctor Parkinson is not permanently
lamed, and we have replaced his lamps.</p>

<p>(g) Personally, knowing Tish’s detestation of
cross-word puzzles, I believe the false clews were
a joke on the part of others concerned.</p>

<p>(h) We did that night what the local police
and the sheriff from Edgewater had entirely
failed to do, and risked our lives in so doing.
Most of the attack is purely jealousy of Letitia
Carberry’s astute brain and dauntless physical
courage.</p>
</div>

<p>I need say no more. As Tish observed to
Charlie Sands the next day, when he came to see
her, lifting herself painfully in her bed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“I take no credit for following the clews; they
were simplicity itself. And I shall pay all damages
incurred. But who is to pay for this cracked
rib and divers minor injuries, or replace poor
Aggie’s teeth? Tell me that, and then get out
and let me sleep. I’m an old woman.”</p>

<p>“Old!” said Charlie Sands. “Old! If you
want to see an aged and a broken man, look at
me! I shall have to put on a false mustache to
get out of town.”</p>

<p>But to return to the treasure hunt.</p>

<p>On the eventful day we worked hard. By arrangement
with Mr. Stubbs, our poultry man, he
exchanged the license plates from his truck for
ours in the morning, and these we put on, it being
Tish’s idea that in case our number was
taken by the local motor policeman, Mr. Stubbs
could prove that he was in bed and asleep at the
time. We also took out our tail light, as Tish
said that very probably the people who could
not unravel their clews would follow us if possible,
and late in the afternoon, our arrangements
being completed, Tish herself retired to
her chamber with a number of envelopes in her
hand.</p>

<p>Lest it be construed that she then arranged the
cross-word puzzles which were later substituted
for the real clews, I hasten to add that I believe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
if I do not actually know, that she wrote letters
concerning the missionary society at that time.
She is an active member.</p>

<p>At 5:30 we had an early supper and one glass
of cordial each.</p>

<p>“I think better on an empty stomach,” Tish
said. “And I shall need my brains to-night.”</p>

<p>“If that’s what you think of Aggie and myself,
we’d better stay at home,” I said sharply.</p>

<p>“I have not stated what I think of your brain,
Lizzie, nor of Aggie’s either. Until I do, you
have no reason for resentment.”</p>

<p>Peace thus restored, we ate lightly of tea, toast
and lettuce sandwiches; and having donned our
knickerbockers and soft hats, were ready for the
fray. Aggie carrying a small flask of cordial
for emergencies and I a flashlight and an angel-food
cake to be left at the Rectory, we started out
on what was to prove one of the most eventful
evenings in our experience.</p>

<p>Tish was thoughtful on the way over, speaking
occasionally of Poe and his system of deductive
reasoning in solving clews, and also of Conan
Doyle, but mostly remaining silent.</p>

<p>Aggie, however, was sneezing badly, due to the
dust, and this annoying Tish, she stopped where
some washing was hanging out and sent her in
for a clothespin. She procured the pin, but was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
discovered and chased, and undoubtedly this is
what led later to the story that the bandits—of
whom more later—had, before proceeding to the
real business of the night, attempted to steal the
Whitings’ washing.</p>

<p>But the incident had made Aggie very nervous
and she took a second small dose of the cordial.
Of this also more later on.</p>

<p>There was a large group of cars in front of
the Rectory. The Smith boys had brought their
flivver, stripped of everything but the engine and
one seat for lightness, and the Cummingses, who
are very wealthy, had brought their racer. Tish
eyed them both with a certain grimness.</p>

<p>“Not speed, but brains will count, Lizzie,” she
said to me. “What does it matter how fast they
can go if they don’t know where they’re going?”</p>

<p>After some thought, however, she took off the
engine hood and the spare tire and laid them aside,
and stood gazing at Aggie, now fast asleep in the
rear seat.</p>

<p>“I could leave her too,” she said. “She will be
of no help whatever. But on the other hand, she
helps to hold the rear springs down when passing
over bumps.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ostermaier then passed around glasses
of lemonade, saying that every hunt drank a stirrup
cup before it started, and Mr. Ostermaier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
gave us our envelopes and the first password,
which was “Ichthyosaurus.”</p>

<p>It was some time before everyone had memorized
it, and Tish utilized the moments to open
her envelope and study the clew. The password,
as she said, was easy; merely a prehistoric
animal. The clew was longer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Two twos are four, though some say more, and i-n-k spells ink.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Water?” I said. “That must be somewhere
by the lake, Tish.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! What’s to prevent your drinking
the lake dry if you want to? I-n-k! It may be
the stationer’s shop; but if it ever saw water, I
don’t believe it. ‘Two twos are four, though
some say more!’ Well, if they do, they’re fools,
and so is Charlie Sands for writing such gibberish.”</p>

<p>What made matters worse was that the Smith
boys were already starting off laughing, and two
or three other people were getting ready to move.
Suddenly Tish set her mouth and got into the car,
and it was as much as I could do to crawl in before
she had cut straight through the canna bed
and out onto the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>The Smith boys were well ahead, but we could
still see their tail light, and we turned after them.
Tish held the wheel tightly, and as we flew along
she repeated the clew, which with her wonderful
memory she had already learned by heart. But no
light came to either of us, and at the crossroads
we lost the Smith boys and were obliged to come to
a stop. This we did rather suddenly, and Mr. Gilbert,
who is a vestryman in our church, bumped
into us and swore in a most unbefitting manner.</p>

<p>“Where the hell is your tail light?” he called
furiously.</p>

<p>“You ought to know,” said Tish calmly.
“Somewhere in your engine, I imagine.”</p>

<p>Well, it seemed that everyone had been following
us, and no one except the Smith boys apparently
knew where to go from there. And just
then a policeman came out of the bushes and
asked what the trouble was.</p>

<p>“Ichthyosaurus,” said Tish absently. “‘Water,
water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink. Two
twos are four, though some say more, and——’”</p>

<p>“Don’t try to be funny with me,” he said. “For
a cent I’d take the whole lot of you into town for
obstructing traffic. You’ve been drinking, that’s
what!”</p>

<p>And just then Aggie sat up in the back seat
and said, “Drinking yourshelf! Go on, Tish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
and run over him. He’sh a nuishance.”</p>

<p>Well, I will say her voice was somewhat thick,
and the constable got on the running board and
struck a match. But Tish was in her seat by that
time, and she started the car so suddenly that he
fell off into the road. As the other cars had to
drive around him, this gave us a certain advantage;
and we had soon left them behind us,
but we still had no idea where to go. Matters
were complicated also by the fact that Tish had
now extinguished our headlights for fear of
again being molested, and we were as often off
the road as on it.</p>

<p>Indeed, once we brought up inside a barn, and
were only saved from going entirely through it by
our dear Tish’s quick work with the brakes; and we
then had the agony of hearing the other cars pass
by on the main road while we were backing away
from the ruins of a feed cutter we had smashed.</p>

<p>We had also aroused a number of chickens, and
as we could hear the farmer running out and yelling,
there was nothing to do but to back out
again. Just as we reached the highroad a load of
buckshot tore through the top of the car, but injured
nobody.</p>

<p>“Luckily he was shooting high,” said Tish as
we drove on. “Lower, and he might have cut
our tires.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>“Luckily!” said Aggie, from the rear seat.
“He’sh taken the crown out of my hat, Tish Carberry!
It was nish hat too. I loved my little hat.
I——”</p>

<p>“Oh, keep still and go to sleep again,” said Tish.
“‘Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to
drink. Two twos are four, though some say
more, and i-n-k spells ink.’”</p>

<p>“So it did when I went to school,” said Aggie,
still drowsily. “I-n-k, ink; p-i-n-k, pink;
s——”</p>

<p>Suddenly Tish put her foot on the gas and we
shot ahead once more.</p>

<p>“Schoolhouse of course,” she said. “The
schoolhouse by the water tower. I knew my subconscious
mind would work it out eventually.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, we were the last to get to the
schoolhouse, and we had to witness the other
cars streaming triumphantly down the road as we
went up, shouting and blowing their horns. All
but the Simmonses’ sedan, which had turned over
in a ditch and which we passed hastily, having no
time to render assistance.</p>

<p>Miss Watkins, the school-teacher, was on the
porch, and as we drew up Tish leaped out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“Pterodactyl!” she said.</p>

<p>“Warm, but not hot,” said Miss Watkins.</p>

<p>“Plesiosaurus!”</p>

<p>“The end’s all right.”</p>

<p>“Ichthyosaurus!” said Tish triumphantly, and
received the envelope. Aggie, however, who had
not heard the password given at the Ostermaiers’,
had listened to this strange conversation dazedly
and now burst into tears.</p>

<p>“There’sh something wrong with me, Lizzie!”
she wailed. “I’ve felt queer ever since we started,
and now they are talking and it doesn’t sound like
sensh to me.”</p>

<p>It was some time before I was able to quiet her,
but Tish had already received the second password,
or sentence, which was “Prevention is better
than cure, ting-a-ling,” and was poring over
the next clew.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Always first in danger, always last to go,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Look inside the fire box and then you’ll know.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I still think that had she taken sufficient time
she could have located this second clew easily and
without the trouble that ensued. But finding
herself last when she is so generally first had irritated
her, and she was also annoyed at Miss Watkins,
it having been arranged that the last car
was to take her back into town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Ostermaier said the clew’s in town anyhow.
And he didn’t think the last car would have
much chance, either,” she said.</p>

<p>“Who laughs last laughs best,” said Tish
grimly, and started off at a frightful speed. Miss
Watkins lost her hat within the first mile or two,
but we could not pause, as a motorcycle policeman
was now following close behind us. Owing to
Tish’s strategy, however, for when he attempted
to come up on the right of us she swerved in that
direction and vice versa, we finally escaped him,
an unusually sharp swerve of hers having caught
him off guard, so to speak, and upset him.</p>

<p>Just when or where we lost Miss Watkins herself
I have no idea. Aggie had again dozed off,
and when we reached the town and slowed up,
Miss Watkins was gone. She herself does not
know, as she seems to have wandered for some
time in a dazed condition before reaching home.</p>

<p>But to the hunt.</p>

<p>I still think our mistake was a natural one.
One would think that the pass sentence, “Prevention
is better than cure, ting-a-ling,” certainly indicated
either a pharmacy or a medical man and a doorbell,
and as Tish said, a fire box was most likely a
wood box. There being only two doctors in the
town, we went first to Doctor Burt’s, but he had already
retired and spoke to us from an upper window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>“We want to examine your wood box,” Tish
called.</p>

<p>“Wood box?” he said, in a stupefied voice.
“What do you want wood for? A splint?”</p>

<p>“We’re hunting treasure,” said Tish sharply.
“‘Prevention is better than cure, ting-a-ling.’”</p>

<p>The doctor closed the window violently; and
although we rang for some time, he did not appear
again.</p>

<p>At Doctor Parkinson’s, however, we had better
luck, discovering the side entrance to the house
open and finding our way inside with the aid of
the flashlight. There was only one wood box on
the lower floor, and this we proceeded to search,
laying the wood out carefully onto a newspaper.
But we found no envelopes, and in the midst of
our discouragement came a really dreadful
episode.</p>

<p>Doctor Parkinson himself appeared at the door
in his night clothes, and not recognizing us because
of our attire and goggles, pointed a revolver
at us.</p>

<p>“Hands up!” he cried in a furious tone.
“Hands up, you dirty devils! And be quick about
it!”</p>

<p>“‘Prevention is better than cure, ting-a-ling,’”
said Tish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>“Ting-a-ling your own self! Of all the shameless
proceedings I’ve ever——”</p>

<p>“Shame on you!” Tish reproved him. “If ting-a-ling
means nothing to you, we will leave
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you don’t!” he said, most unpleasantly.
“Put up your hands as I tell you or——”</p>

<p>I do not now and I never did believe the story
he has since told over the town—that Tish threw
the fire log she was holding at his legs. I prefer
to credit her own version—that as she was trying
to raise her hands the wood fell, with most unfortunate
results. As a matter of fact, the real
risk was run by myself, for when on the impact
he dropped the revolver, it exploded and took off
the heel of my right shoe.</p>

<p>Nor is it true, as he claims, that having been
forced out of his house, we attempted to get back
in and attack him again. This error is due to
the fact that, once outside, Tish remembered
the revolver on the floor, and thinking it might
be useful later, went back to get it. But the
door was locked.</p>

<p>However, all is well that ends well. We had
but driven a block or two when we perceived a
number of the cars down the street at the engine
house, and proceeded to find our next clew in the
box of the local fire engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>The password this time was “Prohibition,”
and the clew ran:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Just two blocks from paradise and only one from hell,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Stranger things than truth are found in the bottom of a well.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Smith boys had already gone on, but we
were now at last on equal terms with the others,
and as the sleep and the cold night air had by
now fully restored Aggie, Tish called a consultation.</p>

<p>“So far,” she said, “the Smiths have had the
advantage of superior speed. But it is my opinion
that this advantage is an unfair one, and that
I have a right to nullify it if opportunity arises.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to catch them first,” I observed.</p>

<p>“We shall catch them,” she said firmly, and
once more studied the clew.</p>

<p>“Paradise,” she said, “should be the Eden Inn.
To save time we will circumnavigate it at a
distance of two blocks.”</p>

<p>This we did, learning later that Hell’s Kitchen
was the name locally given to the negro quarter,
and once more Tish’s masterly deciphering of the
clew served us well. Before the other cars had
much more than started, we espied the Smiths’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
stripped flivver outside the Gilbert place, and to
lose no time drove through the hedge and onto the
lawn. Here, as is well known, the Gilberts have
an old well, long disused, or so supposed. And
here we found the Gilberts’ gardener standing
and the Smith boys drawing up the well bucket.</p>

<p>“Give the word and get the envelope,” Tish
whispered to me, and disappeared into the darkness.</p>

<p>I admit this. I admit, too, that, as I have said
before, I know nothing of her actions for the next
few moments. Personally, I believe that she went
to the house, as she has stated, to get the Gilbert
cook’s recipe for jelly roll; and as anyone knows,
considerable damage may be done to an uncovered
engine by flying stones. To say that she cut
certain wires while absent is to make a claim not
borne out by the evidence.</p>

<p>But I will also say that the Smith boys up to
that moment had had an unfair advantage, and
that the inducing of a brief delay on their part
was not forbidden by the rules, which are on my
desk as I write. However——</p>

<p>As Mr. Gilbert is not only prominent in the
church but is also the local prohibition officer,
judge of our surprise when, on the well bucket
emerging, we found in it not only the clews but
some bottles of beer which had apparently been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
put there to cool. And Mr. Gilbert, on arriving
with the others, seemed greatly upset.</p>

<p>“Hawkins,” he said to the gardener, “what do
you mean by hiding six bottles of beer in my
well?”</p>

<p>“Me?” said Hawkins angrily. “If I had six
bottles of beer, they’d be in no well! And there
aren’t six; there’s only four.”</p>

<p>“Four!” said Mr. Gilbert in a furious voice.
“Four! Then who the dev——” Here, however,
he checked himself; and as Tish had now returned,
we took our clews and departed. Hawkins
had given us the next password, which was
“Good evening, dearie,” and the clew, which
read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Down along the lake front, in a pleasant place,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Is a splendid building, full of air and space.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Glance within a closet, where, neatly looped and tagged,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Are the sturdy symbols of the game they’ve bagged.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Everybody seemed to think it meant the Duck
Club, and in a few moments we were all off once
more except the Smith boys, who were talking
loudly and examining their engine. But Tish
was not quite certain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>“These clews are tricky,” she said. “They are
not obvious, but subtle. It sounds too much like
the Duck Club to be the Duck Club. Besides,
what symbols of dead ducks would they keep?
I’ve never seen anything left over but the
bones.”</p>

<p>“The feathers?” Aggie suggested.</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t keep feathers in a closet. And
besides, there’s nothing sturdy about a feather.
What other large building is on the lake front?”</p>

<p>“The fish cannery,” I said.</p>

<p>“True. And they might keep boards in a closet
with the outlines of very large fish on them. But
the less said about the air there the better. However,
we might try it.”</p>

<p>Having made this decision, as soon as we were
outside of Penzance we began once more to travel
with extreme rapidity, retracing for some distance
the road we had come in on, and thus it happened
that we again saw the motorcycle policeman with
his side car. He was repairing something and
shouted angrily at us as we passed, but we did
not even hesitate, and soon we arrived at the fish
cannery.</p>

<p>None of the others had apparently thought of
this possibility, and when we reached it there was
no one in sight but a bearded watchman with a
lantern, sitting on a barrel outside. Tish hopefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
leaped from the car and gave him the password
at once.</p>

<p>“‘Good evening, dearie.’”</p>

<p>But the wretch only took his pipe out of his
mouth and, after expectorating into the lake, replied:</p>

<p>“Hello, sweetheart. And what can I do for
you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be impertinent,” said Tish tartly. “I
said ‘good evening, dearie’, as a signal.”</p>

<p>“And a darned fine signal I call it,” he said,
rising. “Let’s have a look at you before the old
lady comes along with my supper.”</p>

<p>“I have given you the signal. If you haven’t
anything for me, say so.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it you want?” he inquired, grinning
at us in a horrible manner. “A kiss?”</p>

<p>As he immediately began to advance toward
Tish, to this action on his part may be laid the
misfortune which almost at once beset us. For
there is no question that had it not discomposed
her she would never have attempted to turn by
backing onto the fish pier, which has been rotten
for years. But in her indignation she did so, and
to our horror we felt the thing giving way beneath
us. There was one loud sharp crack followed by
the slow splintering of wood, and the next moment
we were resting gently on some piles above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
the water, with the shattered framework of the
pier overhead and the watchman yelling that the
company would sue us for damages.</p>

<p>“Damages!” said Tish, still holding to the
steering wheel, while Aggie wailed in the rear.
“You talk of damages to me! I’ll put you and
your company in the penitentiary if I have to——”</p>

<p>Here she suddenly checked herself and turned
to me.</p>

<p>“The penitentiary, of course!” she said. “How
stupid of us! And I dare say they keep the ropes
they hang people with in a closet. They have
to keep them somewhere. Speaking of ropes,”
she went on, raising her voice, “if that old fool
up there will get a rope, I dare say we can scramble
out.”</p>

<p>“Old fool yourself!” cried the watchman, dancing
about. “Coming here and making love to me,
and then destroying my pier! You can sit there
till those piles rot, far’s I’m concerned. There’s
something queer about this business anyhow; how
do I know you ain’t escaped from the pen?”</p>

<p>“My dear man,” said Tish quietly, “the one
thing we want is to get to the penitentiary, and
that as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t have any trouble getting
there,” he retorted. “I’ll see to that. Far’s you’re
concerned, you’re on your way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>He then disappeared, and one of the piles yielding
somewhat, the car fell a foot or two more,
while Aggie wailed and sneezed alternately. But
Tish remained composed. She struck a match,
and leaning over the side inspected the water and
so on below us.</p>

<p>“There’s a boat down there, Lizzie,” she said.
“Get the towrope from under Aggie and fasten
it to something. If we can get down, we’ll be all
right. The penitentiary isn’t more than a half
mile from here.”</p>

<p>“I slide down no rope into no boat, Tish Carberry,”
I said firmly.</p>

<p>But at that moment we heard the engine of a
motorcycle coming along the road and realized
that our enemy the policeman had followed us.
And as at that same instant the car again slipped
with a sickening jar, we were compelled to this
heroic attempt after all.</p>

<p>However, it was managed without untoward
incident, Aggie even salvaging the flask of blackberry
cordial. But the boat was almost filled with
water, and thus required frantic bailing with our
hats, a matter only just accomplished when the
motorcycle policeman came running onto the pier.</p>

<p>Whether the watchman had failed to tell him
of the break or not, I cannot say, but we were
no more than under way when we heard a splash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
followed by strangled oaths, and realized that for
a time at least we were safe from pursuit.</p>

<p>Wet as we now were, we each took a small dose
of the cordial and then fell to rowing. Tish’s
watch showed only ten o’clock, and we felt greatly
cheered and heartened. Also, as Tish said by
way of comforting Aggie, the license plates on
the car belonging to Mr. Stubbs, it was unlikely
that we would be further involved for the present
at least.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Owing to the fact that the cars still in the hunt
had all gone to the Duck Club, the brief delay
had not lost us our lead, and we proceeded at
once, after landing near the penitentiary, to the
gate. Our halt there was brief. Tish merely
said to the sentry at the entrance, “‘Good evening,
dearie.’”</p>

<p>“The same to you and many of them,” he replied
cheerfully, and unlocked the gate. We then
found ourselves in a large courtyard, with the
looming walls of the building before us, and on
ringing the bell and repeating the phrase were at
once admitted.</p>

<p>There were a number of men in uniform, who
locked the grating behind us and showed us into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
an office where a young man was sitting at a desk.</p>

<p>I had an uneasy feeling the moment I saw him,
and Aggie has since acknowledged the same thing.
Instead of smiling as had the others, he simply
pushed a large book toward us and asked us to
sign our names.</p>

<p>“Register here, please,” was what he said.</p>

<p>“Register?” said Tish. “What for?”</p>

<p>“Like to have our guests’ names,” he said
solemnly. “You’ll find your cells all ready for
you. Very nice ones—view of the lake and everything.
Front, show these ladies to their cells.”</p>

<p>Aggie gave a low moan, but Tish motioned her
to be silent.</p>

<p>“Am I to understand you are holding us here?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we’re here for. We specialize
in holding, if you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“If it’s that fish pier——”</p>

<p>“Is it the fish pier?” the young man asked of
two or three men around, but nobody seemed to
know.</p>

<p>Tish cast a desperate glance about her.</p>

<p>“I may have made a mistake,” she said, “but
would it mean anything to you if I said ‘Good
evening, dearie’?”</p>

<p>“Why, it would mean a lot,” he said politely.
“Any term of—er—affection, you know. I’m a
soft-hearted man in spite of my business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>But Tish was eying him, and now she leaned
over the desk and asked very clearly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Have you got a closet where, neatly looped and tagged,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>You keep the sturdy symbols of the game you’ve bagged?</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly all the guards laughed, and so did
the young man.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” he said. “So that’s what brought
you here, Miss Carberry? And all of us hoping
you’d come for a nice little stay! Jim, take the
ladies to the closet.”</p>

<p>Well, what with the accident and the hard
rowing, as well as this recent fright, neither
Aggie nor I was able to accompany Tish. I cannot
therefore speak with authority; but knowing
Tish as I do, I do not believe that Mrs. Cummings’
accusation as to what happened at this closet is
based at all on facts.</p>

<p>Briefly, Mrs. Cummings insists that having
taken out her own clew, Tish then placed on top
of the others a number of similar envelopes containing
cross-word puzzles, which caused a considerable
delay, especially over the Arabic name
for whirling dervishes. This not, indeed, being
solved at all, somebody finally telephoned to Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
Ostermaier to look it up in the encyclopedia, and
he then stated that no cross-word puzzles had been
included among the clews. Whereupon the mistake
was rectified and the hunt proceeded.</p>

<p>As I say, we did not go with Tish to the closet
and so cannot be certain, but I do know that the
clew she brought us was perfectly correct, as
follows:</p>

<p>Password: “All is discovered.”</p>

<p>We had no more than read it when we heard
a great honking of horns outside, and those who
had survived trooped in. But alas, what a pitiful
remnant was left! Only ten cars now remained
out of twenty. The Smith boys had not been
heard from, and the Phillipses had been arrested
for speeding. Also Mr. Gilbert had gone into a
ditch and was having a cut on his chin sewed up,
the Jenningses’ car had had a flat tire and was
somewhere behind in the road, and the Johnstons
were in Backwater Creek, waiting for a boat to
come to their rescue.</p>

<p>And we had only just listened to this tale of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
woe when Mrs. Cummings sailed up to Tish with
an unpleasant smile and something in her hand.</p>

<p>“Your scissors, I believe, dear Miss Carberry,”
she said. But Tish only eyed them stonily.</p>

<p>“Why should you think they are my scissors?”
she inquired coldly.</p>

<p>“The eldest Smith boy told me to return them
to you, with his compliments. He found them
in the engine of his car.”</p>

<p>“In his car? What were they doing there?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I asked him. He said that you
would know.”</p>

<p>“Two pairs of scissors are as alike as two pairs
of pants,” Tish said calmly, and prepared to depart.</p>

<p>But our poor Aggie now stepped up and examined
the things and began to sneeze with
excitement.</p>

<p>“Why, Tish Carberry!” she exclaimed. “They
are your scissors. There’s the broken point and
everything. Well, if that isn’t the strangest
thing!”</p>

<p>“Extraordinary,” said Mrs. Cummings. “Personally,
I think it a matter for investigation.”</p>

<p>She then swept on, and we left the penitentiary.
But once outside, the extreme discomfort of our
situation soon became apparent. Not only were
we wet through, so that Aggie’s sneezing was no
longer alleviated by the clothespin, but Tish’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
voice had become hardly more than a hoarse
croaking. Also, we had no car in which to proceed.
Indeed, apparently the treasure hunt was
over so far as we were concerned. But once again
I had not counted on Tish’s resourcefulness. We
had no sooner emerged than she stopped in the
darkness and held up her hand.</p>

<p>“Listen!” she said.</p>

<p>The motorcycle was approaching along the lake
road, with that peculiar explosive sound so
reminiscent of the machine gun Tish had used in
the capture of X—— during the war.</p>

<p>It was clear that we had but two courses of
action—one to return to the penitentiary and
seek sanctuary, the other to remain outside. And
Tish, thinking rapidly, chose the second. She
drew us into an embrasure of the great wall and
warned us to be silent, especially Aggie.</p>

<p>“One sneeze,” she said, “and that wretch will
have us. You’ll spend the night in jail.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather be there thad here any day,” said
Aggie, shivering. However, she tried the
clothespin once more, and for a wonder it worked.</p>

<p>“He’ll hear by teeth chatterig, I’b certaid,” she
whispered.</p>

<p>“Take them out,” Tish ordered her, and she
did so.</p>

<p>How strange, looking back, to think of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
effect which that one small act was to have on the
later events of the evening! How true it is that
life is but a series of small deeds and great
results! We turn to the left instead of the right
and collide with a motorbus, or trip over the tail
of an insignificant tea gown, like my Cousin Sarah
Pennell, and fall downstairs and break a priceless
bottle of medicinal brandy.</p>

<p>So Aggie took out her teeth and placed them
in her ulster pocket, and tied her scarf over her
mouth to prevent taking cold without them, and
later on——</p>

<p>However, at the moment we were concentrated
on the policeman. First he discovered and apparently
examined the boat on the shore, and
then, pushing and grunting, shoved his machine
past us and up to the road. There he left it, the
engine still going, and went toward the penitentiary,
whistling softly and plainly outlined
against the lights of the cars outside. A moment
later Tish had led us to the motorcycle and was
examining the mechanism by the aid of the flashlight.</p>

<p>“It looks easy enough,” she said in her usual
composed manner. “Lizzie, get into the side car
and take Aggie on your lap—and hold on to her.
I wish no repetition of the Miss Watkins incident.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>We watched for a short time, hoping the policeman
would go inside, but he was talking to the
Cummingses’ chauffeur, who seemed to be pointing
in our direction. Seeing then that no time
was to be lost, Tish hastily adjusted her goggles
and pulled down her hat, and being
already in knickerbockers, got quickly into
the saddle. With the first explosion of the
engine the motorcycle officer looked up, and
an instant later began to run in our direction.</p>

<p>But I saw no more. Tish started the machine
at full speed, and to a loud cry from Aggie we
were off with a terrific jerk.</p>

<p>“By deck’s broked!” she cried. “Stop her!
By deck’s broked!”</p>

<p>Her neck was not broken, however, I am happy
to say, and the osteopath who is attending her,
promises that she will soon be able to turn her
head.</p>

<p>How shall I describe the next brief interval of
time? To those who have ridden in such fashion,
no description is necessary; and to those who have
not, words are inadequate. And, in addition,
while it was speedily apparent that we were leaving
our pursuers behind—for the Cummingses’
car followed us for some distance, with the policeman
on the running board—it was also soon apparent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
that our dear Tish had entirely lost control
of the machine.</p>

<p>Unable to turn her eyes from the road to examine
the various controls, an occasional flash of
lightning from an approaching storm showed her
fumbling blindly with the mechanism. Farmhouses
loomed up and were gone in an instant; on
several curves the side car was high in the air,
and more than once our poor Aggie almost left
us entirely. As the lightning became more frequent
we could see frightened animals running
across the fields; and finally, by an unfortunate
swerve, we struck and went entirely through
some unseen obstacle, which later proved to be
a fence.</p>

<p>However, what might have been a tragedy
worked out to the best possible advantage, for
another flash revealing a large haystack near by,
Tish turned the machine toward it with her usual
farsightedness and we struck it fairly in the
center. So great was our impact, indeed, that
we penetrated it to a considerable distance and
were almost buried, but we got out without difficulty
and also extricated the machine. Save for
Aggie’s neck, we were unhurt; and the rain
coming up just then, we retired once more into the
stack and with the aid of the flash again read
over the clew:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Where are you going, my pretty maid?”</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>“’Most anywhere else,” said she.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>“Behind the grille is a nice young man.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>And he’ll give my clew to me.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Going?” said Tish thoughtfully. “‘’Most
anywhere else’? There’s no sense to that.” The
hay, however, had brought back Aggie’s hay
fever, and as sneezing hurt her neck, she was
utterly wretched.</p>

<p>“There’s a heap of sedse,” she said in a petulant
voice. “Bost adywhere else would suit be
all right. Ad if you’re goig to try that dabbed
bachide agaid, Tish Carberry, I ab dot.”</p>

<p>“If you must swear, Aggie,” Tish reproved
her, “go outside, and do not pollute the clean and
wholesome fragrance of this hay.”</p>

<p>“I’d have said worse if I knew adythig worse,”
said Aggie. “And bebbe this hay is wholesobe,
but if you had by dose you wouldn’t thig so.”</p>

<p>“Grille?” said Tish. “A nice young man behind
a grille? Is there a grillroom at the Eden
Inn?”</p>

<p>But we could not remember any, and we finally
hit on the all-night restaurant in town, which had.</p>

<p>“‘’Most anywhere else’ must refer to that,”
Tish said. “The food is probably extremely poor.
And while there we can get a sandwich or so and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
eat it on the way. I confess to a feeling of weakness.”</p>

<p>“Weakness!” said Aggie bitterly. “Thed I
dod’t ever wadt to see you goig strog, Tish Carberry!”</p>

<p>It was owing to Aggie’s insistence that Tish
test out the mechanism of the motorcycle before
any of us mounted again that our next misfortune
occurred. So far, when one thing failed
us, at least we had been lucky enough to find a
substitute at hand, but in this instance we were
for a time at a loss.</p>

<p>It happened as follows: As soon as the rain
ceased, Tish, flashlight in hand, went to the
machine and made a few experiments with it.
At first all went well, but suddenly something
happened, I know not what, and in a second the
motorcycle had darted out of our sight and
soon after out of hearing, leaving our dear
Tish still with a hand out and me holding
a flashlight on the empty air. Pursuit was
useless, and, after a few moments, inadvisable,
for as it reached the highroad it apparently
struck something with extreme violence.</p>

<p>“If that’s a house it’s docked it dowd,” Aggie
wailed.</p>

<p>But as we were to learn later, it had not struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
a house, but something far more significant. Of
that also more later on.</p>

<p>Our situation now was extremely unpleasant.
Although the storm was over, it was almost eleven
o’clock, and at any time we expected to see the
other cars dashing past toward victory. To walk
back to town was out of the question in the condition
of Aggie’s neck. Yet what else could we do?
However, Tish had not exhausted all her resources.</p>

<p>“We are undoubtedly on a farm,” she said.
“Where there’s a farm there’s a horse, and where
there’s a horse there is a wagon. I am not
through yet.”</p>

<p>And so, indeed, it turned out to be. We had
no particular mischance in the barn, where we
found both a horse and a wagon, only finding it
necessary to connect the two.</p>

<p>This we accomplished in what I fear was but
an eccentric manner, and soon we were on our way
once more, Aggie lying flat in the wagon bed because
of her neck. How easy to pen this line, yet
to what unforeseen consequences it was to lead!</p>

<p>As we wished to avoid the spot where the
motorcycle had struck something, we took back
lanes by choice, and after traveling some three
miles or so had the extraordinary experience of
happening on the motorcycle itself once more,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
comfortably settled in a small estuary of the lake
and with several water fowl already roosting
upon it.</p>

<p>But we reached the town safely, and leaving
Aggie, now fast asleep, in the rear of the wagon,
entered the all-night restaurant.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>There was no actual grille to be seen in this
place, but a stout individual in a dirty white apron
was frying sausages on a stove at the back end
and a thin young man at a table was waiting to
eat them.</p>

<p>Tish lost no time, but hurried back, and this
haste of hers, added to the dirt and so on with
which she was covered and the huskiness of her
voice, undoubtedly precipitated the climax which
immediately followed. Breathless as she was,
she leaned to him and said:</p>

<p>“All is discovered.”</p>

<p>“The hell you say!” said the man, dropping
the fork.</p>

<p>“I’ve told you,” she repeated. “All is discovered.
And now no funny business. Give me
what you’ve got; I’m in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Give you what I’ve got?” he repeated. “You
know damn well I haven’t got anything, and what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
I’m going to get is twenty years! Where are
the others?”</p>

<p>Well, Tish had looked rather blank at first,
but at that she brightened up.</p>

<p>“In the penitentiary,” she said. “At least——”</p>

<p>“In the pen!” yelped the man. “Here, Joe!” he
called to the person at the table. “It’s all up!
Quick’s the word!”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Tish. “I was to say ‘All is
discovered,’ and——”</p>

<p>But he only groaned, and throwing off his apron
and grabbing a hat, the next moment he had
turned out the lights and the two of them ran out
the front door. Tish and I remained in the darkness,
too astonished to speak, until a sound outside
brought us to our senses.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, Lizzie,” she cried. “They
have taken the wagon—and Aggie’s in it!”</p>

<p>We ran outside, but it was too late to do anything.
The horse was galloping wildly up the
street, and after following it a block or two, we
were obliged to desist. I leaned against a lamp-post
and burst into tears, but Tish was made of
stronger fiber. While others mourn, Tish acts,
and in this case she acted at once.</p>

<p>As it happened, we were once more at Doctor
Parkinson’s, and even as we stood there the
doctor himself brought his car out of the garage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
and leaving it at the curb, limped into his house
for something he had forgotten. He was wearing
a pair of loose bedroom slippers, and did not
see us at first, but when he did he stopped.</p>

<p>“Still at large, are you?” he said in an unpleasant
tone.</p>

<p>“Not through any fault of yours,” said Tish,
glaring at him. “After your dastardly attack on
us——”</p>

<p>“Attack!” he shouted. “Who’s limping, you
or me? I’m going to lose two toenails, and possibly
more. I warn you, whoever you are, I’ve
told the police and they are on your track.”</p>

<p>“Then they are certainly traveling some,” said
Tish coldly.</p>

<p>He then limped into the house, and Tish caught
me by the arm.</p>

<p>“Into the car!” she whispered. “He deserves
no consideration whatever, and our first duty is
to Aggie.”</p>

<p>Before I could protest, I was in the car and
Tish was starting the engine; but precious time
had been lost, and although we searched madly,
there was no trace of the wagon.</p>

<p>When at last in despair we drove up to the local
police station it was as a last resort. But like
everything else that night, it too failed us. The
squad room was empty, and someone was telephoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
from the inner room to Edgewater, the
next town.</p>

<p>“Say,” he was saying, “has the sheriff and his
crowd started yet?... Have, eh? Well,
we need ’em. All the boys are out, but they
haven’t got ’em yet, so far’s I know....
Yes, they’ve done plenty. Attacked Doctor Parkinson
first. Then busted down the pier at the fish
house and stole a boat there, and just as Murphy
corraled them near the pen, they grabbed his
motorcycle and escaped. They hit a car with it
and about killed a man, and a few minutes ago old
Jenkins, out the Pike, telephoned they’d lifted a
horse and wagon and beat it. And now they’ve
looted the Cummings house and stolen Parkinson’s
car for a get-away.... Crazy? Sure
they’re crazy! Called the old boy at the fish cannery
dearie! Can you beat it?”</p>

<p>We had just time to withdraw to the street
before he came through the doorway, and getting
into the car we drove rapidly away. Never have
I seen Tish more irritated; the unfairness of the
statements galled her, and still more her inability
to refute them. She said but little, merely hoping
that whoever had robbed the Cummings house had
made a complete job of it, and that we would go
next to the railway station.</p>

<p>“It is possible,” she said, “that the men in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
restaurant are implicated in this burglary, and
certainly their actions indicate flight. In that case
the wagon—and Aggie—may be at the depot.”</p>

<p>This thought cheered us both. But alas, the
waiting room was empty and no wagon stood near
the tracks. Only young George Welliver was behind
the ticket window, and to him Tish related a
portion of the situation.</p>

<p>“Not only is Miss Pilkington in the wagon,”
she said, “but these men are probably concerned in
the Cummings robbery. I merely said to them
‘All is discovered,’ when they rushed out of the
place.”</p>

<p>Suddenly George Welliver threw back his head
and laughed.</p>

<p>“Well!” he said. “And me believing you all the
time! So you’re one of that bunch, are you? All
that rigmarole kind of mixed me up. Here’s your
little clew, and you’re the first to get one.”</p>

<p>He then passed out an envelope, and Tish, looking
bewildered, took it and opened it. It was the
next clew, right enough. The password was
“Three-toed South American sloth,” and the clew
as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Wives of great men all remind us,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>We can make our wives sublime,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>And departing, leave behind us</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Footprints on the sands of time.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>
<p>“That ought not to be difficult,” said Tish. “If
only Aggie hadn’t acted like a fool——”</p>

<p>“It’s the cemetery,” I said, “and I go to no
cemetery to-night, Tish Carberry.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Tish briskly. “Time certainly
means a clock. I’m just getting the hang of
this thing, Lizzie.”</p>

<p>“‘Hang’ may be right before we’re through.
And when I think of poor Aggie——”</p>

<p>“Still,” she went on, “sands might be an hourglass.
Sands of time, you know.”</p>

<p>“And if somebody broke it by stepping on it,
it would be footprints in the sands of time!” I
retorted. “Go on! All we have to do is to find
an hourglass and step on it. And in the meantime
Aggie——”</p>

<p>However, at that instant a train drew in and
a posse from Edgewater, heavily armed, got out
of it and made for a line of waiting motor hacks.
Never have I seen a more ruthless-looking lot of
men, and Tish felt as I did, for as they streamed
into the waiting room she pushed me into a telephone
booth and herself took another.</p>

<p>And with her usual competency she took advantage
of the fact to telephone Hannah to see
if Aggie had returned home, but she had not.</p>

<p>As soon as the posse had passed through we
made our escape by the other door and were able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
to reach the doctor’s car unseen, and still free to
pursue our search. But I insist that I saw Tish
scatter no tacks along the street as we left the
depot. If she did, then I must also insist that
she had full reason; it was done to prevent an unjustified
pursuit by a body of armed men, and
not to delay the other treasure hunters.</p>

<p>Was it her fault that the other treasure seekers
reached the station at that time? No, and again
no. Indeed, when the first explosive noises came
as the cars drew up she fully believed that the
sheriff was firing on us, and it was in turning a
corner at that time that she broke the fire plug.</p>

<p>Certainly to assess her damages for flooded
cellars is, under these circumstances, a real injustice.</p>

<p>But to return to the narrative: Quite rightly,
once beyond pursuit, Tish headed for the Cummings
property, as it was possible that there we
could pick up some clew to Aggie, as well as establish
our own innocence. But never shall I forget
our reception at that once friendly spot.</p>

<p>As the circumstances were peculiar, Tish decided
to reconnoiter first, and entered the property
through a hedge with the intention of working
past the sundial and so toward the house. But
hardly had she emerged into the glow from the
windows when a shot was fired at her and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
was compelled to retire. As it happened, she took
the shortest cut to where she had left me, which
was down the drive, and I found myself exposed
to a fusillade of bullets, which compelled me to
seek cover on the floor of the car. Two of the
car windows were broken at once and Letitia
Carberry herself escaped by a miracle, as a bullet
went entirely through the envelope she held in
her hand.</p>

<p>Yes, with her customary astuteness she had
located the fresh clew. The Ostermaier boy had
had them by the sundial, and had gone asleep
there. She fell over him in the darkness, as a
matter of fact, and it was his yell which had
aroused the house afresh.</p>

<p>There was clearly nothing to do but to escape
at once, as men were running down the drive and
firing as they ran. And as it seemed to make no
difference in which direction we went, we drove
more or less at random while I examined the new
clew. On account of the bullet holes, it was hard
to decipher, but it read much as follows:</p>

<p>The password was “Keep your head down, ——
boy,” and the clew was as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Search where affection ceases,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>By soft and —— sands.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>The digit it increases,</i></div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>
<p>“After all,” Tish said, “we have tried to help
Aggie and failed. If that thing made sense I
would go on and locate the treasure. But it
doesn’t. A digit is a finger, and how can it stand
on its head?”</p>

<p>“A digit is a number too.”</p>

<p>“So I was about to observe,” said Tish. “If
you wouldn’t always break in on my train
of thought, I’d get somewhere. And six upside
down is nine, so it’s six we’re after. Six
what? Six is half a dozen. Half a dozen eggs;
half a dozen rolls; half a dozen children. Who
has half a dozen children? That’s it, probably.
I’m sure affection would cease with six children.”</p>

<p>“Somebody along the water front. It says:
‘By soft and something-or-other sands.’”</p>

<p>We pondered the matter for some time in
a narrow lane near the country club, but
without result; and might have been there yet
had not the sudden passing of a car which
sounded like the Smith boys’ flivver toward
the country club gate stimulated Tish’s imagination.</p>

<p>“I knew it would come!” she said triumphantly.
“The sixth tee, of course, and the
sand box! And those dratted boys are ahead of
us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>Anyone but Tish, I am convinced, would have
abandoned hope at that moment. But with her,
emergencies are to be met and conquered, and so
now. With a “Hold tight, Lizzie!” she swung
the car about, and before I knew what was on the
tapis she had let in the clutch and we were shooting
off the road and across a ditch.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>So great was our momentum that we fairly
leaped the depression, and the next moment were
breaking our way through a small woods, which
is close to the fourteenth hole of the golf links,
and had struck across the course at that
point. Owing to the recent rain, the ground
was soft, and at one time we were fairly
brought to bay—on, I think, the fairway to the
eleventh hole, sinking very deep. But we
kept on the more rapidly, as we could now see
the lights of the stripped flivver winding
along the bridle path which intersects the
links.</p>

<p>I must say that the way the greens committee
has acted in this matter has been a surprise to us.
The wagon did a part of the damage, and also
the course is not ruined. A few days’ work with
a wheelbarrow and spade will repair all damage;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
and as to the missing cup at the eighth hole, did
we put the horse’s foot in it?</p>

<p>Tish’s eyes were on the lights of the flivver,
now winding its way along the road through the
course, and it is to that that I lay our next and
almost fatal mishap. For near the tenth hole she
did not notice a sand pit just ahead, and a moment
later we had leaped the bunker at the top and shot
down into it.</p>

<p>So abrupt was the descent that the lamps—and,
indeed, the entire fore part of the doctor’s
car—were buried in the sand, and both of us were
thrown entirely out. It was at this time that Tish
injured one of her floating ribs, as before mentioned,
and sustained the various injuries which
laid her up for some time afterward, but at the
moment she said nothing at all. Leaping to her
feet, she climbed out of the pit and disappeared
into the night, leaving me in complete darkness to
examine myself for fractures and to sustain the
greatest fright of my life. For as I sat up I
realized that I had fallen across something, and
that the something was a human being. Never
shall I forget the sensations of that moment, nor
the smothered voice beneath me, which said:</p>

<p>“Kill be at odce ad be dode with it,” and then
sneezed violently.</p>

<p>“Aggie!” I shrieked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>She seemed greatly relieved at my voice, and
requested me to move so she could get her head
out of the sand. “Ad dod’t screab agaid,” she
said pettishly. “They’ll cobe back ad fidish us all
if you do.”</p>

<p>Well, it appeared that the two men had driven
straight to the golf links with the wagon, and had
turned in much as we had done. They had not
known that Aggie was in the rear, and at first she
had not been worried, thinking that Tish and I
were in the seat. But finally she had learned her
mistake, and that they were talking about loot
from some place or other, and she was greatly
alarmed. They were going too fast for her to
escape, although once or twice they had struck
bunkers which nearly threw her out.</p>

<p>But at last they got into the sand pit, and as the
horse climbed up the steep ascent our poor Aggie
had heard her teeth drop out of her pocket and had
made a frantic clutch at them. The next moment
she had alighted on her head in the sand pit and
the wagon had gone on.</p>

<p>She was greatly shaken by her experience and
had taken a heavy cold; but although we felt
about for the blackberry cordial, we could not
find it, and could only believe it had miraculously
remained in the wagon.</p>

<p>As she finished her narrative our dear Tish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
slipped quietly over the edge of the pit and sat
down, panting, in the sand. The storm being
definitely over and a faint moon now showing,
we perceived that she carried in her hand a
canvas sack tied with a strong cord, and from its
weight as she dropped it we knew that at last we
had the treasure.</p>

<p>It was a great moment, and both Aggie and I
then set about searching for the missing teeth.
But as Tish learned of Aggie’s experience she
grew thoughtful.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” she said, “those two men are
somehow concerned in this robbery to-night, and
very probably the rendezvous of the gang is
somewhere hereabouts. In which direction did
they go, Aggie?”</p>

<p>“They’ve parked the wagod over id those
woods.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Tish, “it is our clear duty——”</p>

<p>“——to go hobe,” said Aggie sharply.</p>

<p>“Home nothing!” said Tish. “Jail is where we
go unless we get them. There are fifteen policemen
and a sheriff coming for us at this minute,
and——” But here she stopped and listened intently.
“It is too late,” she said, with the first
discouragement she had shown all evening. “Too
late, my friends. The police are coming now.”</p>

<p>Aggie wailed dismally, but Tish hushed her and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
we set ourselves to listen. Certainly there were
men approaching, and talking in cautious tones.
There was a moment when I thought our dear
Tish was conquered at last, but only a moment.
Then she roused to incisive speech and quick
action.</p>

<p>“I do not propose to be dug out of here like a
golf ball,” she stated. “I am entitled to defend
myself and I shall do so. Lizzie, see if there are
any tools in the car there, and get a wrench.”
She then took a firm hold of the treasure bag and
swung it in her hand. “I am armed,” she said
quietly, “and prepared for what may come.
Aggie, get the clothespin, and when I give the
word point it like a pistol.”</p>

<p>“Ab I to say ‘bag’?”</p>

<p>But before Tish could reply, the men were
fairly on us. We had but time to get behind the
car when we could hear their voices. And suddenly
Aggie whispered, “It’s theb! It’s the baddits!
Ad they’ve beed at the cordial!”</p>

<p>And Aggie was right; they had, indeed, as we
could tell by their voices.</p>

<p>“It wash Bill, all righ’,” said one man. “I
shaw the litsh of hish car.”</p>

<p>“Well, wheresh he gone to? No car here, no
anything. Black ash hell.”</p>

<p>One of them then began to sing a song, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
which he requested a bartender to give him a
drink, but was quickly hushed by the others, for
there were now three of them. Whether it was
this one or not I do not know, but at that instant
one of them fell over the bunker at the top of the
pit and came rolling down at our feet, and Tish,
with her customary readiness, at once struck him
on the head with the bag of pennies. He was
evidently stunned, for he lay perfectly still, and
the men above seemed puzzled.</p>

<p>“Hey, Joe!” they called. “Where are you?”</p>

<p>On receiving no reply, one of them lighted a
match, and Tish had only time to retire behind
the car before it flared up.</p>

<p>“Well, can you beat that? He’sh broken hish
neck!”</p>

<p>But the man with the match was sober, and he
saw the car and stared at it.</p>

<p>“If that’s Bill’s car,” he said, as the match went
out, “we’re up against it. Only—where the
devil’s Bill?”</p>

<p>“He’sh dead too, mosht likely,” said the other.
“Everybody’sh dead. S’terrible night. Car’sh
dead, too; buried in a shea of shand. Shinking
rapidly. Poor ole car! Women and children
first!”</p>

<p>He then burst into tears and sat down apparently,
for the other man kicked him and told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
him to get up; and then came sliding into the pit
and bent over Joe, striking another match as he
did so. Hardly had he done so when Tish’s
weapon again descended with full force, and he
fell beside his unconscious partner in crime.</p>

<p>We had now only the drunken man to deal
with; and as Tish wished no more bloodshed, she
managed him in a different manner.</p>

<p>In a word, she secured the towrope from the
rear seat of the doctor’s car and, leaving Aggie
and myself to watch the others, climbed out and
approached him from the rear. It was only the
work of a moment to pinion his arms to his sides,
and as Aggie immediately pointed her impromptu
weapon and cried “Hads up!” he surrendered
without a struggle. Having securely roped
him, we then rolled him into the sand pit
with the others, who showed no signs of coming
to.</p>

<p>Fatigued as we were by that time, and no
further danger threatening for the moment, we
rested for a brief time on the ground and ate a
few macaroons which I had carried in a pocket
against such an emergency. But by “we” I mean
only Tish and myself, as poor Aggie was unable
to do so—and, indeed, has been living on soft
food ever since. Then retrieving the sack containing
the Cummings jewels and silver which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
burglars had been carrying, we prepared to carry
our double treasure back to the town.</p>

<p>Here, however, I feel that our dear Tish made
a tactical error, for after we had found the horse
and wagon—in the undergrowth just beyond the
seventh hole—instead of heading at once for
the police station she insisted on going first to
the Ostermaier’s.</p>

<p>“It is,” she said, examining her watch by the
aid of the flashlight, “now only half past eleven,
and we shall not be late if we hurry. After that
I shall report to the police.”</p>

<p>“And what is to prevent those wretches from
coming to and escaping in the interval?” I asked
dryly.</p>

<p>“True,” Tish agreed. “Perhaps I would better
go back and hit them again. But that would take
time also.”</p>

<p>In the end we compromised on Tish’s original
plan and set out once more. The trip back across
the links was uneventful, save that on the eighth
green the horse got a foot into the hole and was
only extricated with the cup still clinging to his
foot.</p>

<p>We had no can opener along, and it is quite
possible that the ring of the tin later on on the
macadam road led to our undoing. For we had
no sooner turned away from the town toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
Ostermaier’s cottage on the beach than a policeman
leaped out of the bushes and, catching the
animal by the bridle, turned a lantern on us.</p>

<p>“Hey, Murphy!” he called. “Here they are!
I’ve got ’em! Hands up, there!”</p>

<p>“Stand back!” said Tish in a peremptory voice.
“We are late enough already.”</p>

<p>“Late!” said the policeman, pointing a revolver
at us. “Well, time won’t make much difference
to you from now on—not where you’re going.
You won’t ever need to hurry again.”</p>

<p>“But I must deliver this treasure. After that
I’ll explain everything.”</p>

<p>“You bet you’ll deliver it, and right here and
now. And your weapons too.”</p>

<p>“Aggie, give up your clothespin,” said Tish in
a resigned voice. “These yokels apparently think
us guilty of something or other, but my conscience
is clear. If you want the really guilty
parties,” she told the policeman, “go back to the
sand pit by the tenth hole and you will find them.”</p>

<p>“April fool your own self,” said the one called
Murphy. “I’ve been following you for two hours
and I don’t trust you. You’re too resourceful. Is
the stuff there?” he asked the first man, who had
been searching in the wagon.</p>

<p>“All here.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll be moving along,” he said; and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
this fashion did we reach the town once more, and
the station house.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget that moment. Each of us
handcuffed and hustled along by the officers, we
were shoved into the station house in a most undignified
manner, to confront the sheriff and a
great crowd of people. Nor shall I ever forget
the sheriff’s face when he shouted in an angry
voice:</p>

<p>“Women, by heck! When a woman goes
wrong she sure goes!”</p>

<p>The place seemed to be crowded with people.
The fish-pier man was there, and a farmer who
said we had smashed his feed cutter. And
Doctor Parkinson, limping about in his bedroom
slippers and demanding to know where we had
left his car, and another individual who claimed
it was his horse we had taken, and that we’d put
a tin can on his off forefoot and ought to be sued
for cruelty to animals. And even Mr. Stubbs,
because his license plates were on our car—and
of course the old fool had told all about it—and
the Cummings butler, who pointed at Tish and
said that after the alarm was raised she had tried
to get back into the house again, which was, of
course, ridiculous.</p>

<p>I must say it looked bad for us, especially when
the crowd moved and we saw a man lying in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
corner with an overcoat under his head and his
eyes shut. Tish, who had not lost an ounce of
dignity, gazed at him without expression.</p>

<p>“I dare say,” she said, “that you claim that
that is our work also.”</p>

<p>“Just about killed him, you have,” said the
sheriff. “Went right through him with that
motorcycle you stole. Murder—that’s what it’s
likely to be—murder. D’you get his name,
doctor?”</p>

<p>“Only roused enough to say it was Bill,” said
Doctor Parkinson. “I wish myself to lodge a
complaint for assault and battery against these
women. I am per——”</p>

<p>But Tish interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Bill?” she said. “Bill?”</p>

<p>Without a word she pushed the crowd aside,
and bending over Bill, with her poor manacled
hands she examined him as best she could. Then
she straightened herself and addressed the crowd
with composure.</p>

<p>“Under this man’s shirt,” she said, “you will
find what I imagine to be a full set of burglar’s
tools. If your hands are not paralyzed like your
brains, examine him and see.”</p>

<p>And they found them! The picture of that
moment is indelibly impressed on my mind—the
sheriff holding up the tools and Tish addressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
the mob with majesty and the indignation of outraged
womanhood.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, this is one of the gang which
robbed the Cummings house to-night. Through
all this eventful evening, during which I regret
to say some of you have suffered, my friends and
I have been on their track. Had the motorcycle
not wrecked that ruffian’s car, they would now
have safely escaped. As it is, when we were so
unjustly arrested I had but just recovered the
Cummings silver and jewels, and alone and unaided
had overcome the remainder of the gang.
I am exhausted and weary; I have suffered
physical injury and mental humiliation; but I am
not too weak or too weary to go now to the sand
pit at the tenth hole on the golf links and complete
my evening’s work by handing over to the police
the three other villains I have captured.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for the old girl!” somebody
called in the crowd. “I’m for her! Let’s go!”</p>

<p>And this, I think, concludes the narrative of
that evening’s events. It was almost midnight
when, our prisoners safely jailed, we arrived at
the Ostermaiers’ to find all the treasure hunters
except the Cummingses there and eating supper,
and our angel-food cake gracing the center of
the table. Our dear Tish walked in and laid the
sack of pennies on the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>“Here is the treasure,” she announced. “It
has been an interesting evening, and I hope we
shall soon do it again.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ostermaier took up the bag and examined
it.</p>

<p>“I have the honor of stating,” he said, “that
this, as Miss Carberry claims, is the treasure, and
that Miss Carberry wins the hand-painted candlestick
which is the prize for the event.” He then
examined the bag more carefully, and added:</p>

<p>“But this sack seems to be stained. Perhaps
our good sister will explain what the stains are.”</p>

<p>Tish eyed the bag with an expressionless face.</p>

<p>“Stains?” she said. “Oh, yes, of course. I
remember now. They are blood.”</p>

<p>Then, leaving them staring and speechless with
astonishment, she led the way out of the house,
and home.</p>

</div>


<p>In order to understand the case of Emmie
Hartford and the rather drastic method by
which our splendid Tish endeavored to effect
a cure, it is necessary to go back a few months to
that strange but brief period during which Letitia
Carberry developed psychic power.</p>

<p>Not, indeed, that she used her power in the case
referred to; on the contrary, rather. But the
influence of her earlier experiences is plainly to
be discovered by the careful reader, and since she
has been severely criticized for her attitude to
Emmie, as well as for the methods she pursued,
it is only fair to her to revert briefly to the incidents
which preceded the Hartford affair.</p>

<p>It is, I admit, a long step from a book on palmistry
to that frightful evening when Aggie and I
were compelled to sit under the eyes of a policeman
and listen to a number of men digging
frantically in the cellar of the Hartford house
just beneath the room in which we waited. But
that is the way it began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>It was last Christmas that Charlie Sands,
Tish’s nephew, sent her a book on palmistry.
Tish studied it carefully, and for some time Aggie
and I, and even Hannah, her maid, were obliged
to make impressions of our hands on a sheet of
smoked paper while Tish studied the results.
Aggie, I recall, had a line down near her wrist
which worried Tish greatly, revealing as it did an
unbridled and passionate nature, although Aggie
was certain that it was where she had been cut
while paring quinces some years ago. And
Hannah certainly had the circle which indicated
death by drowning. But what is important to
this narrative is that our dear Tish discovered
that she herself had the psychic cross on both
hands.</p>

<p>She at once undertook a study of such matters,
although at first her attitude was largely one of
academic interest, she having always stoutly
maintained that under no circumstances, once
having passed over, would she care to be brought
back and forced to inhabit even temporarily the
body of a medium she might not care for or might
indeed positively dislike.</p>

<p>And, I may say, her interest was largely impersonal
until well on into the spring. Then one
night she had a most curious experience, and there
began that earnest investigation which was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
lead us into such strange paths, and was later,
indeed, to see us driven from the Hartford
home under conditions so unpleasant that only a
sense of fairness to Tish compels me to record
them.</p>

<p>Briefly, then, Tish was reading one evening in
the living room of her apartment, while Hannah
in the kitchen was cutting out a nightgown from
a paper pattern. There was only the light from
the reading lamp, an auspicious fact, since we
have since learned how fatal is light to these delicate
phenomena, and it so happened that there
was on the table beside her a vase of flowers and
also a pitcher of drinking water. Since both
water and flowers greatly assist in psychic manifestations,
it will be readily seen that, without
Tish knowing it, the stage was already set for the
drama which ensued.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard a faint rustling, and on
glancing up there was the sleeve pattern of
Hannah’s nightgown moving across the doorsill
and into the room!</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that, in her surprise, she
dropped her book and thus broke the ectoplasmic
force, or whatever it may be called. The paper
instantly ceased to move. But her interest was
naturally aroused, and with her usual promptness
she at once inaugurated a series of sittings, consisting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
of the three of us—Aggie, Tish and myself.
Later on, for one experiment, we persuaded
Hannah to join us, with results so startling that
neither she nor Aggie sat again. But even these
early sittings brought surprising results. I quote
a few extracts from Tish’s record, made each
evening after the event, and thus as correct as
possible:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At one <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> last night we secured heavy raps on the
wall next to the Ingersoll apartment, distinctly audible
over the sound of the phonograph.</p>

<p>By an unmistakable affirmative in the usual code of
raps for yes and no, Mr. Wiggins tonight told Aggie he
had desired her to have his cameo scarf pin, and not his
sister, who has it.</p>

<p>C. S.—Charlie Sands—sat with us tonight. Vase of
flowers and bowl of water on floor. He requested that
the spirits place something in the bowl of water, and
since it was Friday, suggested fish. In thirty seconds we
heard a loud plop, and found on turning on the light
that a goldfish was swimming in the bowl.</p>
</div>

<p>Brief as they are, these few extracts prove conclusively
that we were securing results. Already,
a purely amateur circle as we were, we had succeeded
in securing a materialized form. More
than that, the fish remained some days, in every
way acting like a real fish, even eating the food
we placed in the bowl. Indeed, it was only to
leave us later on under circumstances as amazing
as those of its arrival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that we were slowly but
definitely progressing, although small setbacks
and annoyances came our way also. Hannah, for
instance, became so nervous that she constantly
threatened to leave, and on a storm coming up
one night and Tish going into her room in her
nightdress to see if the window was closed, was
only in time to catch her before she leaped out of
the window!</p>

<p>But in the main we were satisfied. True, our
one attempt to utilize a trumpet medium, strongly
recommended by Mrs. Ostermaier as having predicted
Willie’s measles, was most unfortunate.
We had invited Charlie Sands to sit with us, and
the early performance was most surprising. Mr.
Abraham, the medium, went into a deep trance
and the trumpet which had been placed on the
floor moved about and touched us all. Not only
that, but it hovered in the air in front of Charlie
Sands, and after a number of kissing sounds, a
young woman who said her name was Katie and
that she used to know him, asked him to go to a
private sitting at Mr. Abraham’s, because she
didn’t want to make any trouble for him by talking
there.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Katie,” he said. “I don’t seem
to remember you, but be discreet anyhow. And
you might pass that word along over there, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
a lot of folks could come back and make
trouble here if they wanted to.”</p>

<p>Well, she agreed to that and was just sending
another kiss to him through the trumpet, when
she sneezed twice. Tish thought it was Aggie,
but it was not. And while this was being argued
the medium in his chair suddenly gave a terrific
yelp.</p>

<p>“I’ve been injured!” he shouted. “Somebody’s
played a trick on me! I’m damaged! I’m hurt!”</p>

<p>Well, Aggie turned on the lamp, and Mr.
Abraham was on his feet, making dreadful faces
and pulling at the seat of his trousers. Somebody
had put a tack with the point upright on his
chair, and he must have been standing up, for
he had sat down on it. He was very much upset,
and left without waiting to collect his fee at all.</p>

<p>It turned out that Charlie Sands had suspected
him right along, and had blown some snuff into
the trumpet when he was talking to Katie. It
was he, also, who had placed the tack on the chair.</p>

<p>A weaker spirit than Letitia Carberry might
have been discouraged, but Tish was not daunted;
and, although our next sitting was the last we
held, since neither Aggie nor Hannah would so
much as venture into a dark room after it, it was
so conclusive that it left no room for doubt.</p>

<p>To be brief, Tish had always felt that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
materializing a goldfish we had done well, but not
sufficiently well.</p>

<p>“A fish,” she said, “is a lower earth form. It
is soulless and purely material, for there is no
record of water in the higher planes of existence,
since in the spirit we neither thirst nor bathe.
We must do better than that.”</p>

<p>As a result of this resolution we were, as I have
said, compelled to give up our sittings entirely;
but not before we had had a success beyond our
wildest hopes.</p>

<p>On the night in question, then, we had coaxed
Hannah to sit once more, and in a very few
minutes we heard undeniable sounds from the
neighborhood of the open window. As it was
entirely dark we could see nothing, but after a
short time Hannah yelled in a terrified voice that
something was rubbing against her.</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Tish quietly. “If it is a spirit
form it is welcome. Welcome, friend.”</p>

<p>“It’s scratching my leg!” said Hannah in a
dreadful tone.</p>

<p>She then let out a bloodcurdling yell and the
next instant the spirit form had leaped to Aggie’s
shoulder, and she fell from her chair in a dead
faint. We were obliged to turn on the light, but
it was a long time before she could do more than
moan. Naturally the force was entirely dissipated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
by that time; but Hannah was able to show two
long scratches on her leg as evidence, and Aggie’s
shoulder revealed three or four minute punctures
entirely through the skin.</p>

<p>A careful examination of the room also revealed
a startling fact. The goldfish had disappeared
from its bowl!</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a remarkable achievement,
marking as it did our advance from the piscatorial
to the animal plane, and indicating that we might
even hope before long for the materialized human
body. But, alas for Tish’s hopes, neither Aggie
nor Hannah would sit again. So undermined,
indeed, was Hannah’s morale by the incident that
she gave us a considerable fright only a few days
later.</p>

<p>Tish was experimenting with automatic writing
at the time, and had already secured a curious
result. Her hand had drawn first a series of
straight horizontal lines and then crossed them
with a similar number of vertical ones, resulting
in numerous small squares. Then, moving on
inexorably, it had just written beneath: “Number
one horizontal,” when we heard a terrific shriek
from Hannah’s room, followed by another and
another.</p>

<p>The power, of course, was broken, and, on
rushing to Hannah’s assistance, we found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
she had heard strange movements and sounds
from her closet and was convinced that there was
a spirit there. It turned out, however, to be only
the Ingersolls’ cat; a troublesome animal which
had crawled in over the fire escape and was playing
with a mouse it had captured.</p>

<p>But this practically ended our experiments in
that direction. As Tish so justly observed, the
craven heart has no place in the spirit world. I
have related it, however, because indirectly but
surely it had its influence in the Hartford matter.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was just after all this that Aggie’s cousin
Will Hartford came to see her and to ask her to
indorse a note for five hundred dollars. We were
all struck by the change in him; he used to be a
nice-looking man, rather fastidious about his
clothes, but he looked thin and had a bad color
that day, and as shabby as a person could be and
go about.</p>

<p>Aggie was so sorry for him that she would
have done what he asked, but Tish at once advised
against it.</p>

<p>“Lending money to relatives is like lending seed
to a canary bird,” she said. “You get paid only
in song, and some of them can’t sing. What’s
the matter, anyhow, Will?” she demanded, gazing
at him with her usual searching glance. “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
earn a good salary. You oughtn’t to be borrowing
seed—I mean money.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “Emmie’s kind of frail. She
has been most ever since I married her. It’s
mostly a matter of doctors and nurses.”</p>

<p>“Frail, how?” said Tish sharply. “Morally or
physically? She used to be all right. I can remember
when she ate three eggs for breakfast
and was out in the pantry at eleven o’clock for a
glass of milk.”</p>

<p>He looked pained.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t eat now at all, Letitia,” he said
sadly. “She feeds most everything that goes up
on her tray to the dog. I don’t know how she
lives on what she eats.”</p>

<p>Well, poor Will’s story was certainly a sad one.
About ten years ago Emmie had been taken sick.
Fainted. And from that time on she’d just been
up and down. Once they had thought it was a
dropped stomach, and about the time she was all
strapped up for that along came a new doctor and
located something in her gall bladder. Her kidneys
were wrong, too, and they’d got a new
specialist lately who was laying the trouble to the
thyroid gland.</p>

<p>“She’s had so many hypodermics that her poor
skin is full of holes,” he told us. “I guess they’ve
used about a hundred needles on her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a pity somebody wouldn’t use a needle on
you,” said Tish sharply, looking at a hole in his
sock.</p>

<p>But he only put his foot under his chair and
went on about his troubles.</p>

<p>“I don’t like asking for help,” he said, “but
every time I get a little money it goes to doctors
and nurses. I’ve paid a nurse forty dollars a
week for seven years and I’ve been needing a
new suit for the last six of them. And we can’t
keep help. There’s nobody there now but the
nurse. Seems as though the feebler Emmie gets
the worse they treat her.”</p>

<p>Well, he looked so forlorn that Tish sent Aggie
out for some blackberry cordial.</p>

<p>“Is she in bed all the time?” she asked.</p>

<p>“She’s up and down. I carry her down to the
living room once in a while, but I can’t do it often.
I’m not so strong as I used to be.”</p>

<p>“Still, as thin as she must be——”</p>

<p>“Well, she isn’t exactly thin,” he said in an
embarrassed manner. “It’s a funny thing, but
she’s put on weight. Of course, weight itself
may be a disease. I guess it is with her, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Tish glanced at him, but he was drinking his
blackberry cordial and didn’t notice it. He was
certainly shabby, and his face had sort of fallen
in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter with your teeth?” Tish said
suddenly.</p>

<p>“I’ve lost one or two of them,” he admitted. “I
haven’t liked to take the time away from her to
get them looked at. You see”—he looked away
from us, out of the window—“you see, I may not
have her long. I don’t want ever to feel that I—that
I failed her in any way.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity it isn’t Emmie who’s lost her teeth,
and not you,” said Tish. “Since she doesn’t need
them and you do.”</p>

<p>But he looked pained at that; so she told him
she would think things over and let him know
what Aggie would do, and he went away. On his
way out Tish asked him suddenly what sort of a
dog they had, and he seemed surprised.</p>

<p>“It’s a Pekingese,” he said, and went out with
his shoulders bent, like an old man.</p>

<p>After he had gone Aggie told us more about
Emmie. She said it was a great pity about her,
not forty yet and on her deathbed, but that that
sort of weakness ran in the family.</p>

<p>“Her mother was delicate, too,” she said. “For
twenty-five years she never came downstairs.
Her mother carried up every bite of food she
ate.”</p>

<p>“What happened to her then?” Tish put in,
rousing herself. “Did she die?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>“No, but her mother did,” Aggie said.</p>

<p>“And then who carried the tray?”</p>

<p>“Well, she began to get better about that time,
and she lived to be eighty. She would be living
now, poor soul, but she got on a chair one night
to reach a piece of pie that somebody had hidden
in the pantry, and she fell off and broke her
neck.”</p>

<p>Tish seemed very thoughtful as she went back
to her apartment. She told Aggie not to do anything
about the note for a time; that she would go
and think over the situation. It was that night
that she called me up and asked me how large a
Pekingese dog was, and I told her the one her
niece, Lily May Carter, had, weighed about seven
pounds.</p>

<p>“You’re sure of that, are you?” she inquired.
“It’s not the size of a police dog or a mastiff?”</p>

<p>“Not unless it’s grown considerably since I saw
it,” I assured her.</p>

<p>“Then,” she said, “I fancy things at Will Hartford’s
are in a very bad way. We’d better go
there, Lizzie.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that Emmie’s going to die,
Tish?”</p>

<p>“I do, indeed,” said Tish dryly. “At eighty or
ninety, if I can restrain myself so long, she will
pass on. But Will Hartford is in a bad way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
And so, I should judge,” she added cryptically,
“is the Pekingese dog.”</p>

<p>We left two days later to see Emmie. It suited
none of us to go. It was almost time for the
annual meeting at the church, where we invariably
serve the supper. Also Aggie was having an early
attack of hay fever, which the dust of the motor
trip did nothing to allay. All in all, only a strong
sense of duty took us, a genuine spirit of self-sacrifice;
and when I think of that last evening
there, with the house full of doctors and policemen,
I cannot restrain a certain sense of bitterness.</p>

<p>We acted entirely for the best. If the results
were not what we anticipated, surely the fault is
not ours. And how true, indeed, are these lines,
secured only the other day by Tish through the
medium of automatic writing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>There swims no goose so gray but soon or late</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>She finds some honest gander for her mate.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was the night before our departure that Tish
and I sat together for advice on the situation,
Aggie definitely refusing to join us.</p>

<p>We got rather feeble results, as the power was
evidently low; but on her asking if we should go
to the Hartfords’, the table very clearly rapped
“Yes.” Whether, after I had gone, Tish received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
further instructions or not I do not know,
but I am inclined to think she did. For one
reason, I doubt if the idea of breaking a spring
in her car and thus prolonging our stay there
originated with her. She is very fond of her car.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the suggestion that I take
along my small bathroom scale was clearly her
own. Also, I imagine, the ipecac and the raw
beef. Though of an idealistic type, the practical
side of her nature is also extremely well developed.</p>

<p>But that she succeeded in breaking not one
spring, but an entire set of them, was a proof undoubtedly
that she was being carefully guided.
I still think, and Aggie agrees with me, that she
could have done so without us in the car, and
thus have saved Aggie much physical discomfort—at
the third ditch her poor head went entirely
through the top.</p>

<p>But at least she achieved her purpose, and we
limped into the untidy drive in front of the Hartford
house in a considerably demoralized condition.
The house was as run down as the property,
and what with it being a mile beyond the village
and isolated, and having a cemetery just across
the road, it was as gloomy a place as ever I have
laid eyes on. The front porch had not been swept
for months, and the doorbell was disconnected, so
we had to hammer for admission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>We learned later that the sound of the bell
annoyed Emmie.</p>

<p>Will Hartford himself opened the door and I
cannot say that he burst into shouts of joy when
he saw us. He had heard us drive up, and he
came out onto the front porch with his finger to
his lips and a worried look on his face.</p>

<p>“Sh!” he said. “She’s had a bad day, and
she’s resting now. Most folks leave their cars
out in the road so as not to disturb her.”</p>

<p>“We had to drive in,” said Tish, “because of
our luggage, Will.”</p>

<p>Well, he looked at the car then, and when he
saw the bags in it he went quite pale.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he said. “So you’re staying over-night,
are you? Well, I guess you’d better come in, but
don’t make any noise. The nurse dropped the
thermometer a few minutes ago, and Emmie
hasn’t yet recovered from the shock.”</p>

<p>We tiptoed inside, and he went out and carried
in our bags and the bathroom scale. But he had
not been quite prepared for the weight of the
scale, and just inside the door it slipped and fell
with a terrible crash on the floor. It caught his
foot, too, and there was nothing subdued either
about the racket or the way he swore.</p>

<p>Tish said she took heart from that minute. It
showed that he was not entirely crushed. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
there was a yelp from upstairs, and the next
minute a nurse in uniform dashed down the stairs.</p>

<p>“You’ve got the aromatic ammonia in your
pocket,” she said to him. “She’s fainted again.”</p>

<p>Well, he let go of his foot and gave her the
bottle, and Tish watched her rush up the stairs
with a queer look on her face.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that that noise made
Emmie faint?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Her nerves are about gone,” he whispered,
all subdued again. “Any unexpected sound almost
kills her. I’ve had to put a piece of felt on
the back porch, so the milkman can put down his
bottles quietly.”</p>

<p>He limped into the living room and while Tish
took the car to the garage in the village we followed
him. Just one look around was enough for
me, and the dust started Aggie to sneezing again
at once. He closed the door with a pained expression
and said he was glad to see us once more,
and asked Aggie if she still made cream puffs
with whipped-cream filling. Then he groaned,
and said that he was a criminal to be thinking of
the flesh when Emmie, as like as not, was near the
end of the road.</p>

<p>And at that moment the dog scratched at the
door and he let it in. It was a tiny thing and as
thin as a rail, and when Tish came back from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
leaving her car at the garage she took one look at
it and said:</p>

<p>“Why don’t you feed that poor little beast?”</p>

<p>“Feed it!” he said. “It has worms, or something.
It eats enough for two men. Last night
it ate Emmie’s sweetbread entire, and then came
down and tried to take my pork chop from me.”</p>

<p>He sighed and then limped to the door again.</p>

<p>“I’ll have some beds made up for you,” he said.
“I guess we can manage for one night.”</p>

<p>“It may be more than one night,” said Tish,
looking him straight in the eye. “They have to
send away for those springs, Will.”</p>

<p>“Well, two nights then,” he said, and went out
of the room, closing the door softly behind him.</p>

<p>It did not require any keen intelligence to show
us that we were not welcome, and I said so to
Tish.</p>

<p>“Personally,” I observed, “I imagine he would
rather have the whooping cough!”</p>

<p>“Not the whooping cough,” said Tish. “That’s
noisy, Lizzie.” She then walked to the door,
opened it and slammed it hard. “There’s no
death here yet,” she said, “although there may
be, if I don’t hold myself in. Where’s that dog?”</p>

<p>Well, the poor little thing had crept under a
sofa, and was almost too feeble to crawl out.</p>

<p>“Eats her food, does he?” said Tish. “So nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
feeds him downstairs, and he’s starving to
death. Here,” she said, “try this, old boy.”</p>

<p>To our surprise she drew a package of raw
chopped beef out of her pocket, and the way that
creature bolted it was a revelation. Tish watched
him carefully but said nothing, and before Will
came back she had burned the paper in the fireplace.</p>

<p>Well, we didn’t see Emmie before dinner. Will
said somebody or other had slammed a door and
she had gone into a collapse. He’d sent for the
doctor again. As there was no servant, we
pitched in and cooked what was in the house,
which wasn’t much, except for the broiled squab,
baked potato, two rolls, some green peas and a
saucer of ice cream which the nurse took up to
Emmie.</p>

<p>“If she would only eat!” Will said. “And
build up her strength. But she just groans and
turns her face away.”</p>

<p>It turned out that the nurse ate while Emmie
was merely toying with her tray upstairs and
feeding Teddy from it. But that night Teddy
did not go upstairs. He had been fed and was
asleep under the table. And it wasn’t more than
five minutes after the nurse and the rest of us
had sat down to our frugal repast when we heard
Emmie feebly calling for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>“You see?” Will said, hopelessly. “She won’t
touch it, and she’s calling Teddy.”</p>

<p>“And Teddy isn’t going!” said Tish. “He’s
under the table at my feet.”</p>

<p>Well, all through the meal we could hear Emmie
weakly calling the dog, and Will and the nurse
kept running up to see if she was all right. Once
Will came down and tried to carry the dog up,
but he ran out into the kitchen and into the yard,
and he couldn’t catch him.</p>

<p>“Emmie’s frightfully upset,” he said in a worried
way. “She has fancies like this, and I don’t
like to cross her. But that dog has crawled under
the porch and I don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p>Tish said nothing. Later on the tray came
down untouched, and Will said Emmie was in a
very bad way. She would not speak to him, and
just lay there staring at the ceiling.</p>

<p>“She looks as though she is staring into
eternity,” he said. “To think of me sitting here
eating like an animal, and my poor wife——”</p>

<p>He was so overcome he had to leave the room,
and Aggie got out her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s the end, Tish,” she whimpered.</p>

<p>“It is the end,” Tish said shortly, “or it will
be unless somebody holds me.”</p>

<p>It was that evening that Will took Tish to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
window and pointed out the lot he had selected in
the cemetery across the road.</p>

<p>“It has a good view, you see, Letitia,” he told
her. “And her sainted mother lies there too.
There is room for me beside her also. I shan’t
outlive her very long.”</p>

<p>“No,” Tish said dryly, “I imagine you’ll not
outlive Emmie, Will; not to amount to anything
anyhow.”</p>

<p>We had a long talk with Will that night. We
had dusted the living room and started a fire there,
and he seemed to relax. He even lighted a cigarette,
after Tish had told him that if he sat near
the fire the smoke would go up the chimney.</p>

<p>Emmie, it seemed, didn’t like tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>“It affects her heart,” he said. “I smoke outside,
and then come in and change my coat. The
faintest odor sickens her.”</p>

<p>The trouble, he said, had been coming on for
some years.</p>

<p>“We’d been talking about getting a car,” he
said, “and I didn’t feel able to. I remember she
had just said she wasn’t as well as she might be,
and that she needed a car for fresh air; and when
I said that I couldn’t afford it she fell over just
like that.” He snapped his fingers. “In a heap.
That was the beginning.”</p>

<p>“And it’s gone on ever since?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. She just wouldn’t take care of herself.
And I didn’t understand. I used to ask her to do
things. The second attack came when I asked her
to wash out a pair of golf hose for me. The
laundress always shrunk them, and I thought—well,
she took cold, and it settled on her lungs.
Every now and then she has a hemorrhage.”</p>

<p>“A large one?” Tish asked.</p>

<p>“I’ve never been around when she’s had one,
but they weaken her terribly,” he said. “The
worst thing about it all is I’m responsible. I
never did realize just how delicate she was until
it was too late.”</p>

<p>We sat there for a while, and he seemed glad
to talk and be warm at the same time. But after
a while the nurse tiptoed in and whispered that
Emmie wanted him, and he slipped out and
creaked up the stairs.</p>

<p>“I always read to her in the evenings,” he
explained as he left. “It’s the least I can do, and
it’s all she has.”</p>

<p>Tish was very thoughtful that evening, and
after Will had read to Emmie until she was
sleepy, and tucked her up and fixed her window
and taken her ice water and moved her bell closer
to her and given her an eggnog, which was all,
he said, she could keep down, he locked up the
house and we went to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t worry if you hear me moving about
in the night,” he said. “The nurse has to sleep
sometime.”</p>

<p>“And when do you sleep?” Tish inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, I get a nap now and then, and then I sleep
in the train going up to business in the morning
and coming back in the evening.”</p>

<p>The last thing I heard that night was Emmie’s
bell ringing hard. I heard Will get up and go
into her room, and when I dropped off he was
still there, soothing her about something.</p>

<p>I had been asleep for perhaps three hours when
I was wakened by a terrific crash from somewhere
below, and I leaped out of bed. Across the hall
I heard Will moving, and the next moment he ran
down the staircase. Tish was not in her room,
and, convinced that something dreadful had occurred,
I hurried down in my nightdress.</p>

<p>I could hear Tish’s voice in the pantry, and
Will moaning and saying Emmie was dead, and
when I opened the pantry door I thought at first
that she was.</p>

<p>She was lying on the floor in a dead faint, with
a slice of bread and butter in her hand, and Tish
was standing over her keeping Will off.</p>

<p>“She’s all right,” she said. “Let her alone.
She’ll come round all right.”</p>

<p>“But she’s fainted,” Will yelled. “Get Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
Smith. Ring up the doctor. Pour some water
over her.”</p>

<p>Tish did this last. She turned on the cold-water
tap, filled a dipper, and flung its contents
hard in Emmie’s face. And if ever I’ve seen a
fainting woman look furious Emmie did. But
she only opened her eyes and said weakly:</p>

<p>“Where am I?”</p>

<p>“You’re here, darling,” said Will, trembling
all over. “You’ll be all right now.”</p>

<p>“How did I get here?” she whimpered.</p>

<p>“You walked here,” Tish said dryly. “You
didn’t fly, you know, Emmie.”</p>

<p>Well, she couldn’t have flown anywhere. She
was as fat as butter, and as healthy-looking a
woman as ever I’ve seen. Will had run to telephone
for the doctor, and Emmie seemed to realize
the bread and butter, for she held up the hand
that had it and said feebly:</p>

<p>“What’s this?”</p>

<p>“Just what it looks like, Emmie,” said Tish.</p>

<p>“Strange!” she whispered. “I don’t remember
anything. Who found me here, and when?”</p>

<p>“I did,” Tish said coldly. “You had just
spread on the butter and were reaching for the
jam when I came in.”</p>

<p>She gave Tish a look of absolute hatred, and
then the nurse ran in and drove us out. Later on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
we heard poor Will carrying her up the staircase,
and when he bumped against the rail with her
she yelped. He twisted his back doing it, but
when the doctor came he said it had been a curious
case of somnambulism.</p>

<p>“In her state of weakness,” he said, “it’s
impossible to believe that she walked down
those stairs, Miss Carberry. She must have slid
down.”</p>

<p>“She walked down. I was behind her.”</p>

<p>“Why on earth didn’t you stop her?”</p>

<p>“I had an idea that maybe she was hungry,”
Tish said quietly.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We did not feed Teddy the next morning, but
we weighed him when he followed the breakfast
tray to Emmie’s room. And when he came down,
having supposedly eaten all of Emmie’s breakfast,
he had lost two ounces!</p>

<p>Tish gazed at the scales angrily.</p>

<p>“As I thought!” she observed. “And that poor
devil of a husband hasn’t probably been out of
this house at night for five years, or had a sock
darned in ten! If he had any sense he’d take up
with another woman.”</p>

<p>“Why, Tish!” said Aggie, aghast.</p>

<p>“If there’s anything more immoral than that
woman lying up there in bed and taking everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
Will gives her and giving nothing back, I
haven’t heard of it.”</p>

<p>“She’s his wife.”</p>

<p>“She’s not his wife,” said Tish. “She’s a
cancer, that’s what she is. Cancers thrive,
but the people who have ’em die. And he’s got
her.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was that morning that Emmie decided to
make the best of a bad job and see us, and all the
time the nurse was fixing her up for the doctor’s
visit she told us her symptoms. For a dying
woman she certainly was particular about her appearance,
for she was dressed up to beat anything
in a silk nightgown, and with her hair crimped.
Just before the nurse went out she sprayed her
with violet water, and Emmie stopped whining
about serums and blood pressure long enough to
say that she had to use perfume because the smell
of cooking in the house upset her poor weak
stomach.</p>

<p>“And Will is so thoughtless,” she said. “Would
you believe that he brought home spareribs and
sauerkraut the other night? And it isn’t more
than ten days since he fried some onions for his
supper! But I suppose men are all alike.”</p>

<p>“No, Emmie,” Tish told her gently. “No, they
are not. There are some men who would as soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
commit murder as not. But your Will isn’t that
sort. Anybody can see that.”</p>

<p>Well, Emmie eyed her suspiciously, but Tish
went on asking her if all the arrangements for the
funeral were made, and if she would like us to
stay on until everything was over.</p>

<p>“We could put the house in order, and so on,”
she said. “I dare say Will will marry again, because
the lonelier they are, the sooner they do it;
but we could leave things tidy. And he would
have to wait a year anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I should think he would,” said Emmie coldly.
“And if you think I intend to have this house put
in order for Will’s second wife you can think
again. Anyhow, Will Hartford has never looked
at another woman and never will.”</p>

<p>“Not even at that nurse of yours?” Tish inquired.
“I was just thinking last night that I
didn’t consider it exactly wise to leave these two
together as much as you do. She’s a right nice-looking
girl.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say I admire your taste!” she said. But
when the nurse came back she gave her a long,
hard look and then said she would take a rest so
as to be ready for the doctor’s visit.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if Will has told you,” she remarked,
“but I’m not supposed to have company.
Excitement is my worst enemy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>“Well, we’re not company, Emmie,” Tish told
her. “You just go on and be as sick as you like.
And don’t worry about us. Nobody with a heart
would leave Will to go through the funeral by
himself. And you might tell us where your grave
clothes are while you’re still able to speak.”</p>

<p>“They’re in the lower bureau drawer,” she said
in a hard voice. And we went out.</p>

<p>When the doctor came that day Tish waylaid
him in the lower hall. And he said Emmie Hartford
could get out of bed and do a day’s washing
any minute she had a mind to. But he said also
that if he told her so she would only shop around
for another doctor, who would tell her she had
something seriously wrong with her. He had not
been paid for a long time, but he did not mind
that as much as the way she made him lose his
sleep.</p>

<p>“My wife says,” he stated, “that she seems to
know the minute I’ve taken my trousers off. I
don’t know when I’ve slept a night through.
Why, if you’ll believe me, the alarm clock in the
kitchen went off at two o’clock the other morning
and I got up in my sleep and was out to the
cemetery here before I wakened.”</p>

<p>Well, after he had gone we sent Emmie a nice
lunch, and soon after, she began to call the dog.
But Tish had fed him and shut him in a closet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
and once more she had to send her tray down
untouched. She was in a villainous temper by
that time and the nurse came down about four
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and said there was something queer about
her. She just lay in bed and stared hard at her.
And when she had told her she was going to put
on a fresh uniform before Will got home, Emmie
had called her something that sounded like a
hussy.</p>

<p>But if Emmie’s condition was worse, Will’s
was distinctly better. He ate a real meal that
evening, and, instead of hurrying up to her afterward,
he sat for a little while in the sitting room.
We had brought along some blackberry cordial,
and he sipped it with appreciation.</p>

<p>“I was making some right good moonshine
myself a while back,” he said. “I bought a still,
you know, and I gave the doctor some one night.
He turned his car over on his way back into
town and broke his arm. But the smell annoyed
Emmie, so I had to give it up.”</p>

<p>Well, Miss Smith came in for a few minutes,
too; she seemed glad to relax for once. But
pretty soon Emmie’s bell began to ring and she
had to go up. It was no time at all before she
came running down the stairs with a thermometer
in her hand and a scared look on her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>“You’d better come up at once, Mr. Hartford,”
she said. “She’s got a terrible fever.”</p>

<p>“How high is it?” asked Will, beginning to
tremble.</p>

<p>“About as high as it can be,” said Miss Smith,
looking worried. “I’ve telephoned to the doctor,
and he says to use a cold pack. But she won’t
have it.”</p>

<p>But as usual, our dear Tish rose to the emergency
at once.</p>

<p>“Certainly she will have it,” she said. “You
crack the ice, Will, and you might mix some salt
with it while you’re at it. There’s no use doing
it unless we do it right. A high fever is not to be
fooled with.”</p>

<p>Well, I don’t know when I remember such a
fuss as Emmie made over that cold pack. She
was strong, too, and it was all we could do to put
her between sheets wrung out of ice water and
then pour the ice and salt over her. She howled
and screamed, but Tish worked calmly.</p>

<p>“You’re killing me!” she would yell. “I’m
dying!”</p>

<p>“You will die if you don’t keep quiet,” Tish
would say.</p>

<p>“But I’ll take cold; I’ll take pneumonia.”</p>

<p>“Not with a temperature like that,” Tish would
assure her, and pour on more ice and salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>They did not stop until her temperature was
down to ninety-five. She would not speak to any
of us by that time, but when it was all over, Tish
came over to the room Aggie and I occupied together
and closed the door.</p>

<p>“I fancy,” she said grimly, “that it will be some
time before she holds the thermometer against her
hot-water bottle again.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As Tish says, the Emmies of this world never
fool the women, although they always fool the
men. But Emmie knew well enough that she had
not fooled us for a minute. And the way she
hated us after the affair of the cold pack was
simply wicked. She would lie in bed and loathe the
very ground we walked on, and when she found it
would take at least a week to repair the car she had
a convulsion and frothed at the mouth. Tish was
quite certain the froth was merely lather from a
cake of soap, but Will was almost out of his mind.</p>

<p>The strangest thing, however, was the way she
had turned against Miss Smith. Possibly the
fact that Tish found a picture of her in Will’s
coat one day while she was repairing it in Emmie’s
room had something to do with it. But both Will
and Miss Smith were as puzzled as could be about
it, and Miss Smith said it had been on her bureau
when she went out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>Will went right down on his knees beside
Emmie’s bed and swore he had always been true
to her.</p>

<p>“There has never been any other woman in my
life, Emmie,” he told her. “I’ve never had any
time for that sort of thing, and you know it.
Surely you can trust me!”</p>

<p>“I trust nobody,” said Emmie grimly. “If you
haven’t the decency to wait until I am gone, which
at the best is a matter of weeks, I can but lie here
and await the end.”</p>

<p>But she couldn’t very well send the nurse away,
for in ten years she had had most of the nurses
thereabouts, and none of them would come back,
and she knew it. She was very suspicious after
that, however, and the very next day, Aggie
happening to dust baking soda instead of powdered
sugar over her cup custard—yes, she was
eating a little by that time; she had to, or
starve—she accused Miss Smith of trying to
poison her.</p>

<p>Naturally, things were considerably strained
from then on, although both Will and the dog
were showing marked improvement. Will would
come home to a clean house and a good dinner
and smoke a couple of cigarettes up the chimney
afterward. Then he would get up heavily and
draw a long breath and say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I’d better be getting on the
job again,” and go slowly up the stairs.</p>

<p>But long after he should have been in his bed,
getting the rest he needed, we could hear him
reading aloud, on and on, until Emmie went to
sleep.</p>

<p>How long this might have continued I cannot
say. But one morning we missed the half of a
coconut cake from the kitchen cupboard, and Tish
promptly went to Will about it.</p>

<p>“None are so blind as those who will not see,”
she said to him. “But if you think, Will Hartford,
that a mouse ate that cake and then put
the pan in the garbage can, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t think anything of the kind,
Letitia,” he protested, looking distressed. “Every
now and then a tramp breaks into a house out
here and eats what he can find.”</p>

<p>Tish gave him a terrible stare, and then she
used an expression I had never before heard from
her lips. “Some people are idiots,” she said, “and
some are just plain fools,” and with that she
stalked out of the room.</p>

<p>She called us together for a council of war,
as she termed it, after he had gone to the
train.</p>

<p>“Two courses are open before us,” she said.
“We can leave the poor deluded imbecile to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
fate, or we can take matters into our own hands.
If the former, we must go; if the latter, that nurse
must get out. I cannot be hampered.”</p>

<p>Well, after some argument we agreed to do
whatever Tish suggested, although Aggie stipulated
that Emmie, being her cousin by marriage,
was to suffer no physical harm. Tish,
on the other hand, demanded absolute freedom
and no criticism. And this being satisfactorily
arranged it remained only to get rid of Miss
Smith.</p>

<p>As it happened, fate played into our hands that
very morning.</p>

<p>The coconut cake had upset Emmie’s stomach,
and the doctor sent some medicine for her. But
Tish met the boy at the door, and, having instructed
us to have the kettle boiling, was able
to steam off the label and place it on the bottle of
ipecac swiftly and neatly. Miss Smith gave her
two doses before it began to act, but when it did
it was thorough.</p>

<p>Well, Emmie was about as sick as any human
could be and live for the next six hours. I suppose
it was the first real sickness she had felt
in ten years, and the fuss she made was dreadful.
There was no use blaming a tramp for the coconut
cake after it either. But what really matters is
that she made them bring Will out from town.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
And between paroxysms she told him Miss Smith
had poisoned her.</p>

<p>Miss Smith left that afternoon, but before she
did she told Will that Emmie was as well as he
was, or even better, and that the doctor knew
it too. But if anyone thinks that Will believed
her he does not know Will Hartford. All he did
was to dismiss the doctor, too, and then come
back to the kitchen and moan about the way people
treated Emmie.</p>

<p>“Even that doctor never understood her,” he
said despondently. “And I must owe him two
hundred dollars or so this minute! Sometimes,
Letitia, I think there is no compassion left in the
world. Even the neighbors neglect her nowadays;
I don’t believe there has been a bowl of calf’s-foot
jelly sent to her in months.”</p>

<p>“Really?” said Tish. “It is surprising, when
you think of the things folks might send her and
don’t. Every now and then you read of somebody
getting a bomb, or poisoned candy.”</p>

<p>He looked at her, but she went on fixing
Emmie’s tray in her usual composed manner.</p>

<p>We had a day or two of peace after that. Tish
brought Doctor Snodgrass, her own physician,
out from town. And after a short talk with her,
he put Emmie on a very light diet and went away
again. As Tish had put a padlock on the kitchen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
cupboard the light diet was all Emmie got, too.
She had a bowl of junket for breakfast, beef tea
for lunch and in the evening she had some
milk toast, and if ever I’ve seen a woman suffer
she did. We did not run every time she rang her
bell, either. She would jingle it for half a dozen
times, and for a feeble woman the way she could
fling it when nobody came was a marvel.</p>

<p>But, looking back, I can see that we underestimated
her intelligence. She had a good bit of
time, by and large, to think things out, and she
was no fool, whatever else she might be. And I
imagine it galled her, too, to see Will filling out
and looking more cheerful every day. He was
spending more time than ever downstairs and,
instead of tiptoeing into the room when he came
home at night, he would walk in briskly and say:
“Well, how’s the old girl to-night?”</p>

<p>He still wandered across to the cemetery now
and then, but we fancied there was more of speculation
than of grief in his face when he picked
the daisies off his lot. And one night, I remember,
he came back and said it was a curious thing that
Emmie’s mother had lived to be eighty, as frail
as she had been, and that Emmie was like her in
a lot of ways.</p>

<p>Tish eyed him.</p>

<p>“She certainly is,” she said. “I thought of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
that the night I found her in the pantry.”</p>

<p>And then one night there was a yell and a crash
upstairs, and when we all ran up, with Will in the
lead, we found Emmie stretched out on the floor,
and she said she was paralyzed from the waist
down!</p>

<p>It took the four of us to get her back into bed.
She gave Tish a glance of triumph when she was
finally installed and then grabbed Will’s hand and
began to groan.</p>

<p>“It’s the last straw,” she moaned. “Until now
I have not been entirely helpless, but this is too
much. I am near the end, William.”</p>

<p>“My poor Emmie!” he wailed. “My poor
afflicted girl!”</p>

<p>Things were not only no better, for all that we
had done, but worse.</p>

<p>Well, Will carried on like a madman, of course.
There were specialists from town and a woman
to massage her legs, but not a muscle would she
move. Except once, when Tish jabbed a pin into
her and she jerked and yelled like a lunatic. But
she had us beaten, of course, for she had worked
it all out in her mind. If she had paralysis she
didn’t have to have anything else, and the very
first thing she asked for was a broiled beefsteak.
After that she ate everything; she ate like a day
laborer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>Tish tried skimping on her tray, but if she got
one egg instead of two in the morning poor Will
would come down looking troubled.</p>

<p>“We must build her up,” he would say. “She
needs all the strength we can give her, Letitia.”</p>

<p>And that was the situation when our poor
Tish finally took matters into her own hands,
with results for which she has been so cruelly
blamed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I have now come to that series of mysterious
events which led, with tragic inevitability, to the
crisis on the night of our departure. And it
may be well here to revert to the subject of
spiritualism.</p>

<p>What with one thing and another Tish had
apparently lost interest in it, hers being a mind
which concentrates on one idea at a time, and
having occupied itself almost entirely with Emmie
since our arrival.</p>

<p>True, such reading aloud as she had been forced
to do for Emmie while Will had laryngitis had
been on such subjects, dealing largely with
specters and apparitions. And both Aggie and I
recalled later that she had told Emmie that the
nearness of the graveyard would make such
materialization comparatively simple.</p>

<p>But Emmie had shown more terror than interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
in the subject, and finally Will had insisted that
Tish abandon it for lighter and more cheerful
material.</p>

<p>It had been seed sown in fruitful ground, however,
as shall presently appear.</p>

<p>To go back then: Will came home very dejected
one night and said he would have to go
away for a business trip. Emmie was most disagreeable
about it.</p>

<p>“And what about me?” she demanded. “Are
you going to leave me here alone?”</p>

<p>“It’s the first time I’ve left you for five years,
Emmie,” he told her. “I’ll just have to go. And
as for being alone, haven’t you got Letitia here?
And Lizzie and Aggie?”</p>

<p>Well, I must admit that that did not seem to
cheer her any, and the look she gave us was most
unpleasant. But she had to let him go, although
her last words were not calculated to send him
away happy.</p>

<p>“If anything happens to me while you are gone,
Will,” she said, “you know how I want things
done. And my black silk dress is in the lower
bureau drawer.”</p>

<p>“I can get back in six hours if I’m needed,
Emmie,” he said brokenly. “A telegram or——”</p>

<p>“When I go I shall be snuffed out like a candle,”
she told him in a cold voice. And with that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
went away, looking as though he was on his way
to the electric chair.</p>

<p>I met Tish on the stairs after she had seen him
off. There was a strange look on her face, I
remembered later; but after she had settled
Emmie for the night she took up her knitting
quietly enough. She always contributes a number
of knitted pairs of bedroom slippers to the Old
Ladies’ Home at Christmas.</p>

<p>Aggie and I retired early, taking Emmie’s bell
with us at Tish’s orders, so she could not disturb
us during the night, and were soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>But judge of our horror when, at two o’clock
or thereabouts, we heard a dreadful shriek from
Emmie’s room, followed by a strange, rushing
sound. As soon as I could move I got out of
bed and turned on the lights; Aggie was reaching
for her teeth, with her eyes fixed on the door.</p>

<p>“I left that door open, Lizzie,” she said in an
agonized whisper. “Somebody’s closed it.”</p>

<p>Well, it certainly was closed, and when I tried
it, it was locked and the key was on the outside!
And, to add to the dreadfulness of our position,
there was no further sound whatever; no whimpering
from Emmie’s room; no sound of Tish in
short and sharp remonstrance. No anything.</p>

<p>Never have we passed through such a half hour
as followed. That both our wonderful Tish and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
Emmie had fallen to the knife or other method of
some deadly assassin we never doubted. And
when at the end of that time we heard halting
but inevitable footsteps slowly climbing the staircase,
both of us were certain that our hour had
come. When they stopped outside the door and
an unseen hand fumbled with the key, Aggie
gave a low moan and made for the window, but
she was stopped before it was too late by the
entrance into the room of Tish herself!</p>

<p>She was a curious dead-white color, and she
came in limping and closed the door.</p>

<p>“I’d like to borrow your tweezers, Lizzie,” she
said, in a toneless sort of voice. “I ran out when
I heard Emmie scream, and I’ve got something
in my foot.”</p>

<p>“But Emmie!” we inquired in unison. “What
has happened to her?”</p>

<p>It was a moment before she replied. Both
Aggie and I remembered that hesitation later and
that there was a hard and determined look on her
face. But when she did reply, it was reassuring.</p>

<p>“She’s all right,” she said.</p>

<p>“But she screamed, Tish! She screamed horribly.”</p>

<p>“You’ve heard her scream before this,” she
said coldly. “She says she saw a ghost. That’s
all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>She went out again, and to her own room. She
was very lame, we noticed, but calm. Some time
later she called to Aggie to bring her the arnica,
and Aggie did so. She reported that Tish had
lost the strange pallor, but that she had got a
number of thorns in her feet and was removing
them.</p>

<p>“She’s very quiet, Lizzie,” Aggie said. “And
I think she’s sprained her ankle. You would
think she had seen the ghost, to look at her,
and not Emmie.”</p>

<p>Well, I felt uneasy myself, especially as something
had certainly locked us in, and after a
while I went across to Emmie’s room and tapped
lightly at the door. It was Tish herself who
answered from the other side.</p>

<p>“Get away from there, Lizzie,” she said sharply.
“We are all right. I shall stay with Emmie until
she is calmer.”</p>

<p>The rest of the night was quiet enough. It
was not until the next day that certain things
began to make us uneasy.</p>

<p>One of these was Emmie herself. However
lightly Tish might treat the matter, refusing to
call a doctor and so on, it was evident that Emmie
had passed through a terrible experience.</p>

<p>She would not see anyone, even Aggie or myself,
and she insisted on keeping her door closed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
and locked. Once in a while we could hear Tish
reading to her, apparently to calm her. And she
ate a little from the trays Tish carried up. But
never once did she raise her voice; ordinarily
when she wanted anything and no one answered
her bell one could hear her shouting, from the
main road. But she was apparently chastened
beyond belief.</p>

<p>Our real anxiety, however, was Tish herself.
She was in a curious nervous state; a thing most
unusual in her. She ate nothing at all. And if
a door slammed she would jump violently and
turn quite pale.</p>

<p>Knowing her as we did, we could only believe
that she, as well as Emmie, had seen the apparition,
and had possibly received a message of some
personal import. It was in a spirit of helpfulness,
therefore, and not of curiosity, that we decided
to remain awake that night to give her moral
support if she required it.</p>

<p>And that very night we saw it ourselves.</p>

<p>Aggie was suffering from a bad attack of
hay fever and had gone to the window for air.
Suddenly I heard her whisper, “Lizzie; cobe here!
It’s outside, od the walk!”</p>

<p>I ran to the window. And there below us, just
leaving the kitchen porch, was the apparition
itself! It was a tall, thin, gray figure. And as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
we watched, it moved along through the back
garden and then, on Aggie sneezing violently,
apparently dissolved.</p>

<p>Although we waited for some time, it did not
materialize again.</p>

<p>In view of Tish’s curious nervous condition,
we did not mention it to her. But we saw it for
three nights in succession.</p>

<p>I must admit that it made us both very uneasy,
especially in view of Emmie’s continued strange
state. If Tish had been her usual buoyant self
we would have gone to her, but she was oddly
restless and uneasy, and once or twice we even
found her dozing in her chair—a thing unprecedented
with her.</p>

<p>But I kept a careful record of the appearance,
and I quote from it here:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Monday. 12 midnight. Materialized human figure.
Gray in color, thin in outline. Ectoplasmic blanket
around shoulders.</p>

<p>Tuesday. 1 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Same figure, but with long rodlike
structure—See Crawford—across both shoulders. Figure
bent, as though carrying weight.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 12:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Same figure, with misty projection
around one arm, simulating basket or pail.</p>
</div>

<p>This ends the record, for on Thursday Will
Hartford unexpectedly came home and a situation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
developed which I cannot yet recall without anger
and dismay.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We had not expected him for some time, but
he let himself in with his latchkey and came back
to the kitchen where Aggie and I were fixing
Emmie’s tray. He looked thin and worn.</p>

<p>“How is she?” he asked, almost in a whisper.
“Still——”</p>

<p>“She’s still alive, if that’s what you mean,”
I said tartly. “Look at this tray and judge for
yourself.”</p>

<p>He was so relieved that he had to sit down and
wipe his face, which was covered with a clammy
sweat.</p>

<p>“I just had to come back,” he said. “I didn’t
even finish the business. What do money and
success matter if I haven’t her with me to share
in them?”</p>

<p>He got up, however, and picked up a large
package he had brought in.</p>

<p>“I brought her some flowers,” he said. “I got
to thinking while I was away. Maybe I could
have done a lot of things to make her happy, but
I’ve been too selfish to think of them. Well——”</p>

<p>Aggie watched him go out. She still had her
hay fever, and standing at the window for three
nights had not improved it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>“What I dod’t udderstad, Lizzie,” she said, “is
why there are so bady healthy wobed in the world.
The bed seeb to like theb feeble.”</p>

<p>And just then Tish, on her way downstairs for
the tray, met Will face to face. She never even
spoke to him. She gave him one awful look, and
then, just as she was, she went out of the house.
She did not come back for the most terrible five
hours of my life.</p>

<p>Now and then, in a nightmare, I hear Will
carrying that box of flowers up the stairs and
opening the door which Tish had forgotten to
lock. And then I hear him give a groan and drop
the box, and then come staggering down again
like a madman, shaking both his fists at us and
shouting at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>“She’s gone!” he yelled. “You’ve lied to me!
She’s dead! Oh, my poor Emmie, and I left you
to die alone!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” I shouted back at him. “Your
poor Emmie’s all right. She’s been eating enough
for ten people right along!”</p>

<p>He stopped wailing and looked at me.</p>

<p>“Then where is she?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“She’s right up in her room in bed. You don’t
see her frying herself over this cookstove, do
you?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
He caught me by the shoulder. “Have you moved her?”
he shouted. “Have you taken my precious girl
out of the room where she has lain helpless so
long, and put her somewhere else? Have you
dared——”</p>

<p>“Oh, take your hands off me,” I said. “She’s
up there all right. Maybe she’s hiding behind
the door to surprise you!”</p>

<p>Well, he ran up again, and we followed him.
But he was right. Emmie’s room was empty;
her bed was neatly made up, and all the bottles
on the table beside it had been cleared away. We
could only stand and stare, while Will Hartford
ran like a lunatic from room to room, peering into
the closets and behind the doors, and moaning
all the time.</p>

<p>“Emmie,” he called over and over. “Emmie!
It’s Will! It’s Will, darling!”</p>

<p>I tried to calm him and tell him she was not
hanging up in a cupboard like an old coat, but
he only turned on me savagely.</p>

<p>“Where’s that woman?” he cried. “Where’s
Letitia Carberry? I didn’t trust her from the
start, and Emmie didn’t either. She has murdered
my poor girl. Murdered her and done
away with her!”</p>

<p>What could we say, or do? We had to stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
by and see him run down the stairs; to hear him
call the local police and accuse our poor Tish
of a heinous crime, and later on to remain helpless
while the officers searched the house and the
cellar, and even dropped a searchlight down into
the well. And still no Tish. They would not even
let us leave the house to search for her, although I
did manage to get Charlie Sands on the telephone
before they stopped me.</p>

<p>“Come at once,” I said. “We are in terrible
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” he said, without excitement.
“Shall I bring bail money or a doctor?”</p>

<p>But I could hear him whistle softly when
I told him that Tish was accused of a murder.</p>

<p>It was seven o’clock by that time and growing
dark. Waiting by a window, we watched for our
poor Tish, but time went on and she did not come.
Eight o’clock. Nine. Ten. Never once did our
loyalty waver, but, on the other hand, what about
the past four days? What about that locked door
into Emmie’s room and the trays that went up,
while Tish ate nothing at the table? What about
that horrible scream and Tish’s strange pallor
afterward?</p>

<p>“Baybe Tish gave ger the wrog bedicide,”
Aggie whispered to me, “ad she died because of
it, so Tish had to——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>But the policeman was watching us, and I
motioned her to be silent.</p>

<p>The house was full of people by that time. Two
or three doctors were working with Will upstairs.
And some neighbors had come in and were digging
a hole in the cellar. All they found was the
still Will had buried there, but the horrible sound
of their spades about drove me crazy. And still
Tish did not come.</p>

<p>Charlie Sands arrived at eleven o’clock. They
were bringing the still up the cellar stairs just as
he got there. And he seemed quite calm and not
at all worried.</p>

<p>“For some reason that reminds me,” he said,
“that a little blackberry cordial would not go
amiss. I’ve had a long trip.”</p>

<p>And not until he had had a generous dose of
this tonic did he make a statement which set the
whole house in a turmoil.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he said, “if you want Miss Carberry,
she will be here in a few moments. She
would have arrived sooner, but one of the garage
men had taken her car out for a joy ride and she
is waiting, to use her own words, to give him a
piece of her mind.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Never shall I forget the scene when Tish arrived,
and, walking quietly into the hall, asked for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
a cup of tea, as she had had no supper. Will,
supported by two of the doctors, was waiting
on the stairs, and he tried to throw himself at
her.</p>

<p>“Supper!” he screeched. “You—you murderess!
What have you done with her? Let me
loose! I want to kill her,” he shouted.</p>

<p>But Tish paid no attention to him whatever.
So far as she was concerned he might not have
been there.</p>

<p>“With a little cinnamon toast, too, Aggie,” she
said. “I’m about famished.”</p>

<p>“She’s brazen!” cried Will. “She’s insane!
Where is Emmie, Tish Carberry?”</p>

<p>She looked at him as if she saw him for the
first time.</p>

<p>“Oh, Emmie!” she said. “Well, that’s a
long story. Now, Aggie, do I get tea, or do I
not?”</p>

<p>Well, they were obliged to wait, for it was clear
she would tell them nothing until she was ready.
They had to lock Will in a room until she had
had it, however, and, although the men who had
been digging in the cellar had stopped work, they
still held onto their spades. They were certain
they would have to dig somewhere.</p>

<p>But at last she had finished, and they brought
Will down again and confronted her with him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
again. She gave him a long, hard look, and then
she smiled.</p>

<p>“You’re a fool, Will Hartford,” she said
calmly, “and your poor helpless Emmie knows it.
That’s why she’s helpless.”</p>

<p>“I know a murderess when I see one,” said
Will.</p>

<p>“As to her being helpless,” Tish went on inexorably,
“let me tell you that, in spite of her total
paralysis, she placed herself where you will find
her, and has since remained there of her own
free will.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie at the start,” said Will. “She
can’t walk a step, and you know it. Officers, if
that woman gets out of this house she will attempt
to escape. It’s a ruse on her part. She’s
got a car at the door.”</p>

<p>Tish sighed.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve done my best for you, Will,” she
told him. “Personally, I don’t care whether
Emmie is found or not. If I have a preference,
it is for the latter. But I’ll take you to her and
the rest is up to you.”</p>

<p>I don’t believe any of them believed her. Will
Hartford, indeed, demanded handcuffs for her,
but she only sat down quietly and refused to
stir if they used them. And when someone said
she ought to be in jail on general principles, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
merely replied placidly that jails were no novelty
to her.</p>

<p>In the end they agreed to let her go free, and
she rose briskly and started out the kitchen door.
It was a strange procession, indeed, and a silent
one, for that had been Tish’s condition.</p>

<p>“One unnecessary sound,” she said, “and I stop.
Later on I shall place you all at a point of observation,
and I shall ask for silence.”</p>

<p>In the hall she had picked up a parcel she had
brought in with her, and she took it with her.
The police were suspicious of it, but on their
threatening to open it she at once turned back,
and they were compelled to let it alone.</p>

<p>As I look back I can still see that strange group—Will
broken and supported by a doctor on each
side, three policemen, six neighbors, mostly armed
with spades, and ourselves. And in the lead our
dear Tish, with no evidence of guilt about her,
but rather as one who has done a good and worthy
deed. She moved swiftly, as though she knew
the way well, up through the pasture behind the
house and through a grove of trees, until at the
other side we could dimly discern a small cabin,
and a light shining through the window.</p>

<p>Here Tish stopped and addressed us.</p>

<p>“We have come a half mile,” she said. “Mrs.
Hartford may tell you that she was brought here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
while unconscious, but she came here on two perfectly
healthy legs. I know, because I followed
her. And she came rapidly,” she added, with
what I felt was a certain significance. “Now I
have one request to make. You will stay here
until I have reached the cabin; then you will come
to the window as silently as possible.”</p>

<p>They let her go, and we did as she had requested.
But never, so long as I live, shall I forget
the sight that greeted us as we stared through
that window.</p>

<p>The cabin was bare, save for a folding cot bed,
a candle on a shelf, a box for a chair and an old
cooking stove with some utensils on it. And lying
on the cot, in a dressing gown over her nightdress,
was Will’s Emmie. She was scowling frightfully,
and when Tish opened the door she nearly
jumped down her throat.</p>

<p>“Do you know what time it is?” she demanded
furiously. “And that I’ve had nothing to eat
since breakfast?”</p>

<p>“I left you plenty for all day,” Tish told her.
“And you know you can get plenty more if you decide
to come home.”</p>

<p>“I’m not walking back, if that’s what you
mean,” Emmie snapped.</p>

<p>“Very well, but you are walking to this cookstove
if you want any supper,” Tish said, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
sat down on the box. “If you could run a half
mile you can walk ten feet.”</p>

<p>I think Will would have broken away then and
there, but Charlie Sands took hold of him. And
the next minute Emmie got off that cot and walked
across the room. She was in a frightful humor,
for she slapped a frying pan onto the stove,
opened the package, and said: “Bacon again! I
hope I never see another pig!” and began to cook
a meal for herself in a most able-bodied but infuriated
manner.</p>

<p>And she ate bread and butter over the stove
while the meat was frying!</p>

<p>Tish only spoke once while this was going on.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity poor Will can’t see you now,” she
said.</p>

<p>“If he was here I wouldn’t be having to do
this,” she snapped.</p>

<p>“No,” said Tish. “The poor fool must like to
be deceived. It’s my experience that the weaker
a man is the more he likes to have something helpless
around him. It makes him feel strong and
protective.”</p>

<p>Well, Will made a noise at that, and Emmie
suddenly threw up her head and listened.</p>

<p>“Who’s out there?” she said in a dreadful
voice.</p>

<p>“Only Will and two or three policemen and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
few neighbors,” Tish told her calmly. “They’re
all glad you are well again, and can take your
place in the——”</p>

<p>But at that Emmie simply leaped at her, and
the next moment Will Hartford was inside,
pulling her off our poor Tish and holding
her so her blows would do no damage.
And then he put his arms around her and
glared at Tish as if she had been the one to
blame.</p>

<p>“Leave!” he said. “Begone! To what brutality
you have submitted my poor wife I have yet
to learn. But the law is not through. Not yet.
Nor am I.”</p>

<p>But Tish only stared at him with a faint and
sardonic smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you are,” she told him. “You’re
through. You’re as through as you can be. I
tried to save you, but you wouldn’t be saved.”</p>

<p>And with that didn’t Emmie suddenly cry out,
“Oh, my poor legs! There’s no feeling in them!
It’s come again.”</p>

<p>And she sagged in his arms, just exactly as
paralyzed as ever.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>No, as Tish has often said, there is no moral
to this tale. Emmie is still paralyzed, but people
get what they want in this world, and if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
want a helpless woman she’s about the easiest
thing there is to obtain.</p>

<p>But it has been necessary to relate it as accurately
as possible, because of the stories that
have been going round.</p>

<p>Tish certainly never dreamed that Emmie
would leave the house. All she meant to do by
playing ghost was to prove that she was not
paralyzed at all, but had two perfectly good legs.</p>

<p>But Emmie’s legs were even better than Tish
had expected. She says, and I have never known
her to exaggerate, that Emmie never went down
the stairs at all, but leaped over the stair rail.
And when Tish tried to catch her, because she
was in her nightgown and the night was cool, the
silly fool simply kept on running.</p>

<p>It was daylight the next morning when Tish
finally located her in the cabin. But the chances
are that Emmie saw her coming, for when Tish
went in she was lying on the floor with her eyes
closed, and she only opened them when Tish shook
her.</p>

<p>Then she stared around feebly and said,
“Where am I? And how did I get here?”</p>

<p>She would not walk back, and Tish knew it was
hopeless from that minute.</p>

<p>As I have said, there is no moral whatever to
this story. The nearest I can come to it is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
couplet Tish secured by automatic writing the
other day:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>There swims no goose so gray but soon or late</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>She finds some honest gander for her mate.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And even there, as dear Tish so aptly remarks,
there is a question. For how honest is a man who
wants those about him to be weak so he can feel
strong?</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
